# Report 2 - NAT and DNS analysis

![](https://cdn.lynda.com/course/157341/157341-636909971425095787-16x9.jpg)

The objective of this task is to analyze the mechanics of NAT and DNS using a variety of network utilities and to use your findings to help you answer the questions defined below.

## Part I: NAT Analysis
In this section, you will use `netstat` and `netstat-nat` to analyze the state of network connections from several different perspectives on your LAN.

### Installation

`netstat` is a powerful tool for viewing information about sockets and connections on Windows, Linux, and macOS devices. The tool is installed by default by all major desktop OS vendors, though you'll find that the command line options vary slightly between implementation.

`netstat-nat` provides a similar interface to `netstat` with the purpose of diving more deeply into the behavior of routed network connections and NAT. Use `apt` to install `netstat-nat` on your Pi.

!!! important "Root Permissions"
    `netstat-nat` requires root permissions in order to run properly on your Pi, while `netstat` can be run without having to invoke `sudo` (but may provide more detailed information when used in that way).

### Usage Tips

The most common options for `netstat` across all three operating systems are `-an`. The `-a` option instructs netstat to display server as well as client sockets, while `n` disables reverse DNS resolution and keeps the output easier to interpret.

!!! tip "Tip: Reducing netstat output"
    `netstat` can produce an overwhelming amount of information. To focus your attention, you can limit the output to a single protocol, e.g., tcp or udp. The syntax for this option on Windows and macOS is `-p <PROTO>`, e.g., `netstat -anp tcp`. For Linux, use  `-t` to select only TCP sockets and `-u` to select only UDP packets.

When running `netstat-nat`, the most useful view for this combination of options will be `-SNn`. This will show you source and destination IP addresses as well as the entries in your Pi's NAT table associated with each connection.

### Analysis instructions
Setup your computer to use the Pi as a router (wifi disabled) so that you can use `netstat` and `netstat-nat` to examine open Internet connections from multiple perspectives. 

You will obtain the most information by running `netstat` on your own computer back-to-back with `netstat-nat` on your Pi. You should also experiment with `netstat` on your Pi, though you'll find it does not show you any data about routed connections.

Take some time to understand what these perspectives are showing you (it may be helpful to run `netstat` without `-n` temporarily to obtain more information about the protocols and destination hosts). Try to correlate connections shown in `netstat` on your computer with the connections appearing in your NAT tables. 

## Part II: DNS Analysis
In this section, you will use the `tshark` utility (a commandline version of Wireshark) in order to analyze DNS requests from the perspective of your Pi's external network interface.

[Install and configure](/resources/tshark-install/) `tshark` on your Pi and perform the two following captures of DNS as described below.

### Capture &num;1 - Perform a capture of DNS queries being **routed through the Pi**

Setup your computer to use the Pi as a router (wifi disabled) and launch a `tshark` capture on the `wlan0` port of your Pi.

With `tshark` running, perform a manual DNS query from your computer to a **public DNS resolver** such as 1.1.1.1. Since your computer is now using your Pi as its default DNS resolver (based on the configuration performed by DHCP), you will need to manually override the DNS settings for your query. 

!!! info 
    Both `dig` and Powershell's `Resolve-DNSName` command provide the functionality to override the system's default resolver. Use `man` or other resources to find the correct syntax for your system.

!!! important
    Save a copy of your capture and make note of the domain queried.

### Capture &num;2 - Perform a capture of DNS queries being **resolved by your Pi**:

Setup your computer to use the Pi as a router (wifi disabled) and launch a `tshark` capture on the `wlan0` port of your Pi.

With `tshark` running _on your Pi_, clear BIND's resolver cache _on your Pi_ (run `sudo rndc reload` on the Pi) and perform a manual DNS query _from your computer_ to the Raspberry Pi based recursive resolver.

!!! important
    Save a copy of your capture and make note of the domain queried.

### Tips
* Use Wireshark's search capabilities to look for the string in the packet details of the capture. 
* Use _capture filters_ to limit the capture to port 53 and _display filters_ to further cut down on the noise of the capture (see below).
    * In addition to your DNS queries, you may see a lot of additional DNS traffic being generated by your computer and the Pi. The following display filter will eliminate DNSSEC related queries and queries generated by _network time protocol_: `dns && !(dns.qry.type in {43 48} || dns.qry.name contains "ntp.org")`. 

## Questions
### Part I
Briefly describe NAT in your own words along with an explanation of what information it collects in order to track and masquerade connections on your behalf. Use screenshots and illustrations from the sockets you observed.

!!! note
    For research purposes, you may also want to search Port Address Translation (PAT). This is the tehcnical term for the variant of NAT that we are utilizing.

### Part II
For each capture, summarize the message(s) that were involved in resolving **your DNS queries**.

        * Packet # from the wireshark capture
        * Source and Destination IP address
        * Tranport layer protocol and port
        * Message type, e.g., query/response
        * Record types included in the response, e.g., NS, A, or AAAA

Looking at each pair of messages above, identify what type of DNS server provided back the corresponding response (Resolver, Root Name Server, TLD Name Server, or Authoritative Name Server).

Using the data you've captured for illustration (along with other resources), compare and contrast the two sets of queries (Capture &num;1 and Capture &num;2) from the perspective of your Pi. What was the role of the Pi in each of these captures? What work did it have to do in order for you to receive a response to your question?
