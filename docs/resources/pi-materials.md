## Materials: A Closer Look

### Compute

The main hardware you need for this course is a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. The Pi is a compact, single-board computer that can be used to create a Linux-based router and other common network components.

We recommend the 2GB version of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, but if you ever plan to do other projects with the device after this course, feel free to upgrade to the 4GB model. 

We don't recommend the kits because they don't align well with our needs, and you can often save a lot of money by only buying the parts you need. That being said, feel free to buy a kit if you want it for the convenience. Make sure that you get all of the 6 required minimal parts in the list above, though. 



If you are shipping within the US, you may be able to get reasonable delivery times from these suppliers (Amazon is quoting one month for Seattle, so don't order it there unless you the shipping time is faster where you live): 

- [PiShop.US](<https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-2gb/?src=raspberrypi>) (Recomended)
- [Canakit](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-2gb.html?cid=usd&src=raspberrypi>) 
- [Chicago Electronics Distributors](<https://chicagodist.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-2gb?src=raspberrypi>)



### Power

You will need something to power the Raspberry Pi. Typically in this course, we use external USB battery banks, but since this course is now remote, you can rely on AC (wall outlet) power instead.

If going the **AC** power route, you need a USB-C power supply. We recommend the [official power supply found here](<https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-15w-power-supply-us-white/?src=raspberrypi>), but it may be easier to order it with your Pi as an add-on item. You can use another power supply if you have one, provided it meets the required specifications. **The power supply needs to provide 3 amps of current at 5 volts, and needs to have a USB-C at the charging end. You can see if your power supply provides 3 amps of current by** looking on the back of the power supply, where it will say something like 5V3A; 5V, 3A; 3A; or 3000mA. Note: we are talking about amps (A) and milliamps (mA), NOT milliamp-hours (mAh). **If it says something smaller, like 2.4A or 1A, that won't cut it**, and you need something else, like the recommended model. Also, you will need to power your Pi while your computer is on, so please don't assume you can use your only laptop charger to power your Pi!

If going the **battery bank** power route, you will need a strong USB battery bank. We recommended [this power bank](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CZZXXMW) that we have tested to work great with the Pi. **If you want to use your own, the battery bank must have 5 volt output at 3 amps, no less, and needs to have a USB-C at the charging end. You can check if your battery bank provides 3 amps of current by** looking on the back of the battery bank, where it will say something like 5V3A; 5V, 3A; 3A; or 3000mA. Note: we are talking about amps (A) and milliamps (mA), NOT milliamp-hours (mAh). **If it says something smaller, like 2.4A or 1A, that won't cut it**, and you need something else, like the recommended model.



### Storage

In addition to the Raspberry Pi (and power), you will need a **fast microSD card (> 8GB)** on which to install the Linux operating system. I typically order these from Amazon to save money, but it may be easier to order with your Pi as an add-on item. 

- [Sandisk 16GB on Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073K14CVB)
- [PNY 32GB on Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R8GVGN9)



### Ethernet Adapter

In addition to the Pi, please check on whether your computer has a [built-in ethernet port](<https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/45/Connect-an-Ethernet-Cable-to-a-Laptop-Step-2.jpg/v4-760px-Connect-an-Ethernet-Cable-to-a-Laptop-Step-2.jpg>) available (most modern laptops do not). Since you will need to connect to ethernet in order to manage your Pi, you may need to purchase a **USB-based Ethernet adapter**. Determine whether your computer is USB-A or USB-C and then pick accordingly.

- If your computer only has [USB-A](<https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/6/2/0/e/3/5113cf7fce395fb17e000000.JPG>) ports, you need a USB-A to Ethernet adapter [Recommended US Seller](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BBD7NFU)
- If your computer only has [USB-C](<https://store.hp.com/app/assets/images/uploads/prod/what-is-usc-c-hero1548124348621.jpg>) ports, then you need a USB-C to Ethernet adapter [Recommended US Seller](<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013G4ECF0?tag=kitco079-20>)



### Ethernet Cable

You will need an **[ethernet cable](<https://media-cdn.seeedstudio.site/media/catalog/product/cache/9d0ce51a71ce6a79dfa2a98d65a0f0bd/h/t/httpsstatics3.seeedstudio.comimagesproductblack20ethernet20cable.jpg>)** long enough to connect your computer's ethernet port to your Raspberry Pi. Many people can find one of these at home, but you may need to purchase if you don't have one available  [Recommended US Seller](<https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-RJ45-Cat-6-Ethernet-Patch-Cable-5-Feet-1-5-Meters/dp/B00N2VILDM/>)



### MicroSD Card Reader

Finally, you will need a way to write to a microSD card. This is essential for setting up your Pi, but you shouldn't need it after the initial set-up. If you don't have access to a computer with a [built-in SD reader/writer](<https://support.hp.com/doc-images/208/c01564370.jpg>), a USB microSD card reader/writer will be essential.

- If your computer only has [USB-A](<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OJ5WBUE?tag=kitco079-20>) ports, you need a USB-A microSD card reader/writer [Recommended US Seller](<https://www.amazon.com/Transcend-TS-RDF5K-microSDHC-Reader-Black/dp/B009D79VH4/>)
- If your computer only has [USB-C](<https://store.hp.com/app/assets/images/uploads/prod/what-is-usc-c-hero1548124348621.jpg>) ports, then you need a USB-CmicroSD card reader/writer [Recommended US Seller](<https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Reader-Memory-RS-MMC-Micro/dp/B07NW8RPYN/>)



### Case

An inexpensive case for your Pi is very nice to have, **but is optional**. The Pi by itself is a bare PCB, like a motherboard, so it is prone to damage if mishandled or placed in a bag without any other protection.



Because we are remote, the Pi should be safe without a case at your house, **but please keep the cardboard box the Pi came in as a safe place to store it when not in use.** 

Most cases protect the Pi within a plastic shell. Some cases come with extra supplies, like heatsinks (metal fins that stick on the chips on the Pi to provide passive cooling), or even fans to cool the Pi. These aren't necessary for this class, but do help your Pi push itself to its limits in terms of CPU power, so they are nice especially if you are planning to use your Pi for other projects after this course.

Right now on Amazon, I only found one case that does not have one-month shipping times. [Recommended Case](<https://www.amazon.com/Flirc-Raspberry-Pi-Case-Silver/dp/B07WG4DW52>). This case comes with a nice heatsink for passive cooling. This case does not, however, come with a fan, so you may want to get a different case by doing your own research, or waiting a month for something with a fan like [this case](<https://www.amazon.com/MazerPi-Raspberry-Cooling-Heatsink-Model/dp/B07W3ZMVP1>). Just make sure that the case supports a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.
