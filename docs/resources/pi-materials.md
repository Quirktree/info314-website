## What is a Pi?
Many of the labs and exercises are built around Raspberry Pi 3 Model B/B+ hardware. The Pi is a compact, single-board computer that can be used to create a Linux-based router and other common network components.

## TLDR;

  * Order the Raspberry Pi hardware.
  * Instructions and links can be found at this [Amazon link](http://a.co/az2BcED).
  * Please only buy one of each category, don't buy duplicates, for example there is no need to buy two cases.
  * Do not use or buy any model that is older than the `3B`.

### Compute (and case)
Either the Pi Model 3B or 3B+ will meet the requirements for this course. You may be able to complete the projects with an older Pi or other single-board computer. If you do run into issues later in the course, we should be able to provide you with a loaner to complete remaining assignments. Please talk to the instructor at the start of the quarter if this is your intention.

Since the Pi ships as a bare circuit board, you’ll want some sort of case to provide protection. The official case linked on my Amazon list runs about $7, but there are many other options as well. If you’re feeling thrifty, you can even make something out of a heavy paper or other materials you already have (​http://sixes.net/rdcHQ/mosh/raspberry.pi.b.plus.pdf​).

###  Power
Like all computers and electronics, the Pi needs a good source of power. The specs for the power source are incredibly important. While there are plenty of USB power bricks and cables around, you need a set that will provide 5V at a minimum of 2.4A. If your equipment does not meet these specs (or you have low quality cables), you’re likely to experience a lot of frustration as you work on later labs and place more demand on your Pi.
						
We tried out all sorts of solutions in previous quarters, but the most convenient is to utilize a USB battery pack with a microUSB connector. After much searching, I came up with a couple of options that work well and can be picked up on Amazon for less than $15. Unless you understand how to verify power specifications, I recommend that you follow our recommendations.

### Storage
The Pi has very simple storage requirements. It relies on a microSD card of the sort you would use in a digital camera or cell phone. We recommend an 8 - 16GB card that meets the Class 10 or UHS-1 speed specifications. Since prices move around a lot, I’ve included several cards that I’ve tested on the Amazon list.
				
If you can afford it, a second storage card or a small USB flash drive may be useful. It’s relatively easy to boot the Pi to a USB drive if you end up needing to troubleshoot a non-booting Pi without a monitor or keyboard.
