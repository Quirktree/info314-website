### What is Markdown

"Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)" [source](https://readwrite.com/2012/04/17/why-you-need-to-learn-markdown/). You will be expected to use this syntax for most of your class reports. You will find a file called `README.md` in the root of all of your GitHub repo folders. This is where you will be doing most of your markdown work.

### How do I get started?

Don't worry if you are unfamiliar with Markdown, it's really easy to pick up. Github has great documentation on all of the things you can do with it here: [ mastering-markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) guide. Once you've taken a look at it follow this beginner's tutorial: [markdowntutorial.com](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

### Preview Markdown

When you're editing your `md` file in your computer, you'll want to know what your text would look like on Github as you're typing. I recommend installing a couple extensions on VS code in order to make your life easier: `Markdown Preview Github` and `Markdown All in One`.

Each has instructions at the time of installation on how to use them.

### Markdown -> PDF

**`grip`** is a command line tool that will easily convert your markdown file to a `pdf` or `html` file.

Installation instruction github.com/joeyespo/grip.

Usage: `grip <file name>.md --export`
