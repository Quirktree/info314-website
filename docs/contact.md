**Asking teaching staff for help**

As teaching staff, both the instructor and the teaching assistant are here to help you as much as possible. We will both be available on Slack for questions. Nevertheless it is expected that you will have attempted to solve the issue as much as possible before reaching out for help. Below are some guidelines:

**When should I reach out?**

You should reach out for help if you have:

* Written down what your problem is
* Written down why you think you are seeing this behavior
* Completed your own debugging
* Completed your own research

**How should I ask?**

* It is highly encourages that you ask your questions in a Slack Channel.
  * You will get a response back much more quickly either from a student are teaching staff this way.
* In your message explain the problem and what you have tried so far.
