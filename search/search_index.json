Part I: NAT Analysis \u00b6 In this section, you will use netstat and netstat-nat to analyze the state of network connections from several different perspectives on your LAN. Installation \u00b6 netstat is a powerful tool for viewing information about sockets and connections on Windows, Linux, and macOS devices. The tool is installed by default by all major desktop OS vendors, though you'll find that the command line options vary slightly between implementation. netstat-nat provides a similar interface to netstat with the purpose of diving more deeply into the behavior of routed network connections and NAT. Use apt to install netstat-nat on your Pi. Root Permissions netstat-nat requires root permissions in order to run properly on your Pi, while netstat can be run without having to invoke sudo (but may provide more detailed information when used in that way). Usage Tips \u00b6 The most common options for netstat across all three operating systems are -an . The -a option instructs netstat to display server as well as client sockets, while n disables reverse DNS resolution and keeps the output easier to interpret. Tip: Reducing netstat output netstat can produce an overwhelming amount of information. To focus your attention, you can limit the output to a single protocol, e.g., tcp or udp. The syntax for this option on Windows and macOS is -p <PROTO> , e.g., netstat -anp tcp . For Linux, use -t to select only TCP sockets and -u to select only UDP packets. When running netstat-nat , the most useful view for this combination of options will be -SNn . This will show you source and destination IP addresses as well as the entries in your Pi's NAT table associated with each connection. Analysis instructions \u00b6 Setup your computer to use the Pi as a router (wifi disabled) so that you can use netstat and netstat-nat to examine open Internet connections from multiple perspectives. You will obtain the most information by running netstat on your own computer back-to-back with netstat-nat on your Pi. You should also experiment with netstat on your Pi, though you'll find it does not show you any data about routed connections. Take some time to understand what these perspectives are showing you (it may be helpful to run netstat without -n temporarily to obtain more information about the protocols and destination hosts). Try to correlate connections shown in netstat on your computer with the connections appearing in your NAT tables. Part II: DNS Analysis \u00b6 In this section, you will use the tshark utility (a commandline version of Wireshark) in order to analyze DNS requests from the perspective of your Pi's external network interface. Install and configure tshark on your Pi and perform the two following captures of DNS as described below. Capture #1 - Perform a capture of DNS queries being routed through the Pi \u00b6 Setup your computer to use the Pi as a router (wifi disabled) and launch a tshark capture on the wlan0 port of your Pi. With tshark running, perform a manual DNS query from your computer to a public DNS resolver such as 1.1.1.1. Since your computer is now using your Pi as its default DNS resolver (based on the configuration performed by DHCP), you will need to manually override the DNS settings for your query. Info Both dig and Powershell's Resolve-DNSName command provide the functionality to override the system's default resolver. Use man or other resources to find the correct syntax for your system. Important Save a copy of your capture and make note of the domain queried. Capture #2 - Perform a capture of DNS queries being resolved by your Pi : \u00b6 Setup your computer to use the Pi as a router (wifi disabled) and launch a tshark capture on the wlan0 port of your Pi. With tshark running on your Pi , clear BIND's resolver cache on your Pi (run sudo rndc reload on the Pi) and perform a manual DNS query from your computer to the Raspberry Pi based recursive resolver. Important Save a copy of your capture and make note of the domain queried. Tips \u00b6 Use Wireshark's search capabilities to look for the string in the packet details of the capture. Use capture filters to limit the capture to port 53 and display filters to further cut down on the noise of the capture (see below). In addition to your DNS queries, you may see a lot of additional DNS traffic being generated by your computer and the Pi. The following display filter will eliminate DNSSEC related queries and queries generated by network time protocol : dns && !(dns.qry.type in {43 48} || dns.qry.name contains \"ntp.org\") . Questions \u00b6 Part I \u00b6 Briefly describe NAT in your own words along with an explanation of what information it collects in order to track and masquerade connections on your behalf. Use screenshots and illustrations from the sockets you observed. Note For research purposes, you may also want to search Port Address Translation (PAT). This is the tehcnical term for the variant of NAT that we are utilizing. Part II \u00b6 For each capture, summarize the message(s) that were involved in resolving your DNS queries . * Packet # from the wireshark capture * Source and Destination IP address * Tranport layer protocol and port * Message type, e.g., query/response * Record types included in the response, e.g., NS, A, or AAAA Looking at each pair of messages above, identify what type of DNS server provided back the corresponding response (Resolver, Root Name Server, TLD Name Server, or Authoritative Name Server). Using the data you've captured for illustration (along with other resources), compare and contrast the two sets of queries (Capture #1 and Capture #2) from the perspective of your Pi. What was the role of the Pi in each of these captures? What work did it have to do in order for you to receive a response to your question?

As we've discussed in class, DHCP is a function that is sometimes performed by routers and is a necessary service whenever we are creating a new network (of almost any type). Before you Start \u00b6 Before starting any of the work within this checkpoint, make sure that you have completed all steps from checkpoint one, including the networkd setup. You must also have completed the Address Planning Exercise correctly. You will use the parameters you selected in that exercise to configure the IP address for the Pi as well as the configuration for isc-dhcp-server . Configure Static Addresses for your Raspberry Pi \u00b6 In this step, you will add a new configuration file to networkd in order to set up static addresses on eth0 . The addresses you use here will be the one you defined for your DHCP Server and Default Gateway in the LAN Planning Exercise . Please do not try to follow other tutorials for setting up addresses Every quarter, we have students who choose to follow online tutorials instead of the instructions we've provided. Please be aware that we are not using the default Raspberry Pi networking. These tutorials will often instruct you to configure static addresses in the /etc/dhcpcd.conf file or /etc/network/interfaces . Both of these methods were disabled when we set up networkd . Create a file named 20-eth0.network in /etc/systemd/network/ (you'll need to use sudo ) and define a static configuration that includes your chosen IP address and CIDR range. This path should already contain a default configuration for ethernet interfaces, e.g., 99-eth.network . We are overriding this configuration for eth0 by naming the file in such a way that networkd will load it first and by ensuring that the configuration will match eth0 exactly. Your file should look something like: [Match] # We only want to match the eth0 interface Name=eth0 # Provide full address config in abbreviated notation [Network] # Default Gateway / DHCP Server Address=192.168.0.1/24 # Enable link local addresses for IPv6 (FE80::) LinkLocalAddressing=ipv6 Warning Some online references will have you add a gateway and DNS settings for your new interface. You don't need to (and definitely shouldn't) add either to this interface. This interface does not provide a path for Internet traffic, but your Pi will try to use it that way if it believes it can be used for a default route. Likewise, we don't need to give the Pi DNS settings on Ethernet. The Pi will get it\u2019s DNS from the wireless interface, which received it\u2019s DNS settings from DHCP. In order to test these new settings: Call sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd.service or reboot your Pi. Once you log back in, verify that networkd is running by calling systemctl status systemd-networkd and use the ip addr command to check that eth0 is online with the new address. Attention Make note that the Pi is now assigned to our new subnet, but our computer will still be using it's autoconfigured IPv4 address in the 169.254/16 range. In an IPv4 only world, this would prevent us from talking to the Pi. To fix the problem, we'd have to manually configure a static IP on our laptop in the same range as the Pi's network ID. Fortunately, both devices have autoconfigured IPv6 addresses that will be discovered through mDNS. By default, this is the address that SSH will use. Install and Configure DHCP \u00b6 For this part of the exercise, we'll use the ISC DHCP Server. The ISC server is available in apt repositories, so it can be installed using: sudo apt update sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server Warning Right after installation, isc-dhcp-server will report that it failed to run, and spit out lots of nasty-looking errors. This is normal, as the DHCP server has not yet been configured. Edit /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server to specify the interfaces ( eth0 only) on which to run the DHCP server. Comment out any options pertaining to DHCP for IPv6. The stock DHCP configuration is located at /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf . This file contains a number of example subnet declarations that you are meant to pick and choose from in order to configure the DHCP server and to distribute addresses within your predefined address range. For this assignment, our configuration is quite minimal: Specifications Before you start to configure your subnet, comment out the lines near the top of the file that specify global settings for nameservers and domain (we won\u2019t use them right now). Create a new subnet configuration block using the network ID and network mask you established in the LAN Planning Exercise . Inside the subnet block, define a contiguous range of IP addresses for the DHCP pool out of the address range selected in the LAN Planning Exercise . You may browse the othe options available, but at this point you should not specify anything other than the DHCP lease range. Why don't we configure the default gateway or name servers yet? Students will frequently jump ahead and fill in additional network parameters. The reason we don't want to include these parameters yet is that our Pi is not yet ready to provide an Internet connection. Sending a default route back to your workstation will create a black hole of sorts for Internet traffic. Your computer will try to route the traffic through the Pi, and the Pi will simply drop everything it receives. Test DHCP Server \u00b6 Use systemctl to restart the DHCP service as shown here: sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server.service If you see errors such as the one shown here, you\u2019ll need to continue troubleshooting the DHCP server (see next section). pi@titan:~ $ sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server.service Job for isc-dhcp-server.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See \"systemctl status isc-dhcp-server.service\" and \"journalctl -xe\" for details. Check your local machine to confirm that an IP address in the specified network range was provided. Try running ping from both directions (laptop -> pi and pi -> laptop) to confirm that the IP address and related settings are configured correctly. Warning If you are on Windows, incoming ping requests (those from pi -> laptop) will not get any response. This is because by default Windows Firewall blocks these requests from being answered. To disable this, run a PowerShell prompt as Administrator and enter these commands: New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Allow inbound ICMPv4\" -Direction Inbound -Protocol ICMPv4 -IcmpType 8 -Action Allow New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Allow inbound ICMPv6\" -Direction Inbound -Protocol ICMPv6 -IcmpType 8 -Action Allow ``` Troubleshooting \u00b6 Raspberry Pi OS provides us with several commands to troubleshoot and find errors related to services. Check status and recent log output using systemctl status isc-dhcp-server.service or journalctl -xe . Search the system logs for relevant errors journalctl -u isc-dhcp-server Here are some additional considerations: A misplaced space or bracket may cause DHCP to fail, so pay close attention to syntax. Your Pi will keep it's static address, so be sure that you excluded the address from the lease range in dhcpd.conf . Double check that you\u2019ve configured the server defaults with the correct interface names and commented out IPv6 related settings.

While you don't have very many services or resources available on your network yet, this project should help you explore the ways in which DNS can be used to identify resources on a network as you add them. This task will build upon the work you did in the DNS Planning Exercise . Important With each checkpoint, we expect you to do more of the work on your own. While the initial Pi setup gave clear instructions, we are slowly moving toward giving you specifications and additional context that you need in order to determine the right steps to accomplish the task. In this assignment, you will use the provided reference documents to help you configure the project according to specification. For some students, this can be a challenging adjustment, but it is also a valuable skill to learn and practice as you prepare for technical internships and jobs. Before you start \u00b6 Before you begin, make sure that you have completed all steps through Checkpoint #4 successfully. At this point, BIND is installed and configured so that your Pi can resolve DNS queries from clients inside your LAN. DHCP is configured to provide LAN clients with the IP address of this resolver (via the domain-name-server option), and you have tested that DNS resolution is working. Before you begin, you should also confirm that you have completed the LAN Planning and DNS Planning exercises. You will be required to refer back to these worksheets. Create a new zone file \u00b6 The documentation installed with BIND provides guidance for where to store zone files on your name server. The recommendation for master (primary) name servers, such as the one we are creating, is to store the zone files in /etc/bind or one of its subdirectories. We'll follow this advice below. To get started defining your own zone, create a new sub-directory called zones in /etc/bind as shown below and copy the existing db.local into it as a starting point for creating your zone. Our advice is to follow the convention of naming your zone file after your selected domain, e.g., gradebook.pi is defined in /etc/bind/zones/db.gradebook.pi. Creating your starter zone file sudo mkdir -p /etc/bind/zones sudo cp /etc/bind/db.local /etc/bind/zones/db.gradebook.pi The initial contents of your zone file will look similar to this: ; ; BIND data file for local loopback interface ; $TTL 604800 @ IN SOA localhost. root.localhost.

Use systemctl to verify that the service is running correctly. You can also test your configuration locally on the Pi by running dig @127.0.0.1 ns <DOMAIN_NAME> . Pay close attention to status codes and errors appearing in the response. Update DHCP \u00b6 Your LAN clients should be able to query the new domain without any additional configuration; however, we will take the opportunity to make one additional update to DHCP. Following the same process you've encountered in previous guides add the domain-name option to your subnet configuration. This option configures your LAN clients to recognize your domain name as a default domain name when attempting to resolve hosts, e.g., dig titan would resolve records for titan.gradebook.pi .

Your primary objective in this exercise is to adapt what you've completed in previous tasks to meet the requirements specified below. Although you will be working together as a group on this project, each participant will take the lead on configuring their own network device to integrate into the ISP network. Additional configuration guidance will be made available through Slack. We will walk through new tasks together in our remaining lectures/labs. Important Instructions As soon as possible, please browse to following link and provide the requested information about your group's WireGuard configuration and individual .pi Name Servers: PICANN Registry Take time to plan out the network design and IP address usage with your group before you build. This plan is a mandatory deliverable and will be required before implementation assistance is given. We recommend that you sketch out an initial diagram of the entire network and create a checklist of major settings for each device. Before you start \u00b6 Each of your group members need to have completed the individual project checkpoints before proceeding with the configuration necessary for the final network. Each pi should function as a network gateway while also providing DHCP and private DNS services to an Ethernet-based LAN. Project Details \u00b6 The following outline summarizes the steps that are needed to inter-network your individual LANs and join them up to the global, PiCANN internet core. Once you have completed these tasks, you will be able to route traffic across our class network and participate in friendly email exchanges with your classmates on the .pi top level domain! With your group, review the ASN and address ranges defined at PiCANN and assign and ASN and distinct subnet to each group member. With your group, configure a Debian 10.3 VM at DigitalOcean (or other cloud provider) to act as an ISP router for your group using VPN-based routing links. Design a new address plan for your LAN/WAN presence based on the address range assigned in Step 1 and including a minimum of two subnets . After reviewing your work on previous checkpoints, \"re-number\" your LAN segment using the new LAN subnet, updating the configuration of networkd, DHCP, iptables, and BIND as required for the task. Configure a routing link between your Pi-based router and the cloud-based ISP, setting up both ends of the VPN and the BGP peering relationships. Review the documentation you created for your .pi domain in Checkpoint #5 and update your DNS plan according to your new address plan. Configure additional \"DMZ\" addresses on your Pi and update your DNS zone configuration to serve the new addresses correctly. Install and configure the Docker-based mail servers based on your own network settings. Work with your group to test and document your work, ensuring that routing and DNS are working consistently across your shared ISP and individual Edge routers. Using your shiny new webmail service, send an email to clinton@gradebook.pi . Planning \u00b6 Up until this point, you have each configured your networks with private address ranges of your own choosing. While this is convenient for getting started, it doesn't lend itself well to a class-wide internet where each device must have its own unique addresses. Going forward, we will ask you to re-number your networks to use the assigned address blocks. This will require a small amount of collaboration within your group to assign sub-ranges. Specifications \u00b6 Assign an ASN and a distinct subnet to each member of your team. All ASNs and subnets must fall within the larger range provided for your group. Select an additional ASN to use for peering between your ISP router and the PiCANN core. Update the PiCANN peering directory with this information. Document your team's address range and individual assignments within a markdown document called final-planning.md. This document should be uploaded to your team's repository as soon as possible for referenced during the remaining parts of the project. Documentation \u00b6 As you work through each part of this project, carefully document the decisions that you make. The process of planning and recording documentation will help you to avoid mistakes and simplify the troubleshooting process. Likewise, you will be asked to provide a comprehensive view of your network design within your GitHub repository. Detailed documentation requirements are provided within the Canvas assignments. ISP Router \u00b6 As a group, you will need to set up a new Debian 10.3 droplet at Digital Ocean, install WireGuard and Free Range Routing packages, and configure a WireGuard and BGP to create a routing link with the core network. This link will provide connectivity to the other groups in the class, and the peering relationship you create with the core router will be used to exchange routes between upstream and downstream routers. Completion of this task will require collaboration with the Instruction team. Consult the [PiCANN] registry for VPN/BGP parameters that your group will use to peer with the core router. Fill in the missing values with your public key and the ASN that you assigned to the ISP router. Notify the instruction team via Slack so that we can complete the upstream configuration. Specifications \u00b6 Create a new VM using the $5/mo specs and the SSH key of one of your group members. You may also wish to enable IPv6 (can improve connectivity if any of your team mmembers have IPv6 capable ISPs (such as Comcast). Update /root/.ssh/authorized_keys on your VM to include public keys for each of your group members as well as the following key for the instructor: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIBJTZTstXqjM7lEaFj/pnRNEztiZYu4yhKBZDrUCYMi5 clinton@info314 . Install WireGuard and Free Range Routing (FRR) based on the instructions given in class and the guides posted on this site. Create a new private/public key pair and add the public key to PiCANN along with the public IPv4 address of your router. Referencing your groups configuration parameters in PiCANN, configure a persistent VPN interface to connect to the core based on the legacy Debian networking approach. Configure FRR to enable BGP and establish a peer relationship with the PiCANN core. Refer to the documentation from Checkpoint #3 to enable IPv4 forwarding with sysctl and create iptables rules to allow packets to be forwarded from your WireGuard tunnel interface. As with Checkpoint #3, set the default forwarding policy to drop packets. Make sure that you have updated the peering worksheet in PiCANN with missing parameters and notify the Instruction team that your peer is ready to connect. LAN/WAN Address Planning \u00b6 Specifications \u00b6 Each group member should subnet their PiCANN subnet into 2 - 4 distinct subnets. A minimum of two subnets per LAN are needed to meet the base project requirements. If you would like to experiment with more complex configurations later we recommend four subnets. Use one of your subnets for your internal LAN (providing DHCP and other services to devices accessing through Ethernet). A second subnet should be dedicated to any public-facing services. We'll often associate this subnet with your \"DMZ\". Edge Network Setup \u00b6 After you complete your final planning for your LAN and public address ranges, you should \"re-number\" your LAN connection to use the new LAN address range. To save yourself significant troubleshooting time, proceed carefully with this task and make sure that you apply updates to networkd, DHCP, iptables, and BIND as required to support the new addresses. It will likely be helpful to review your previous work and the guides for the past Checkpoints (especially 1 - 4). The next task in store for you is to establish connectivity and routing to the ISP VM that your group configured earlier. This is a two-part process, as you will need to create a WireGuard interface and configure peering on both routers (Debian VM and Pi). Keep in mind at this point that there are slight differences in the implementation on each end of this connection. The WireGuard configuration on the Debian VM relies on legacy Debian networking configuration while the Pi will be configured with the built-in WireGuard capabilities of systemd-networkd . We have provided reference documentation and video demos for each scenario. The tasks you are completing are not extremely difficult, but there are ample opportunities for confusion. You should review instructions and make sure that your planning documents include all of the IP addresses and other values that you will need. Having this information well organized can be the difference between finishing this task in an hour versus spending several hours debugging. Specifications \u00b6 Update all network-based services on your LAN to use the new IP address ranges as determined by your group assignments and your own address planning. Follow the linked resources to install WireGuard and Free Range Routing (FRR) on your Pi-based router. Create a new WireGuard interface and configure it to peer with the Debian-based ISP router shared with your group. Configure both ends of the VPN tunnel with IP addresses selected from your public/DMZ subnet. These addresses should be documented on your report. Since your Pi router is most likely located behind a NAT, it will not be possible for the ISP router to open/reopen the WireGuard tunnel for traffic directed to your Pi. Configure a persistent keep-alive of 25 seconds in the WireGuard peer settings on the Pi. Enable the FRR BGP daemon and configure your new router based on the provided guides. In order to do this, you will need an ASN and an additional public address to use as a router ID. Make sure that both values are included in your documentation. Log into the ISP router and update its BGP router settings to recognize your Pi-based router as a neighbor You will need the tunnel addresses from the previous step and the ASN identifiers assigned by your group to the ISP and your Edge network. Repeat the configuration process on your local router, setting up a peering (neighbor) relationship with the ISP. Use the network directive to configure your local BGP to advertise the entire LAN/WAN subnet range that you were assigned by your group. Update iptables to enable packet forwarding from your new WireGuard interface. .Pi DNS Resolution \u00b6 We've intentionally set up all of our domains within the non-existent .pi top-level domain and are limiting the resolution of these domains to our class network. By default, our resolvers won't be able to perform queries against other .pi domains since the recursive process depends on relationship between the ICANN root and the top-level domain registries. Our TLD is not present in those data stores, so we need to offer it a little help to resolve .pi domains. The work-around we're employing is to have each of your resolvers maintain a copy of the .pi zone so that it can directly discover the authoritative name servers of your peers' domains. The primary name server for .pi is running at the 10.10.10.10 address. By adding the following section to your /etc/bind/named.conf.local, your pi will perform a zone transfer with 10.10.10.10 and then periodically refresh based on the settings specified in the SOA for the TLD. zone \"pi\" IN { type slave; masters { 10.10.10.10; }; }; Note If you've configured separate views for internal and external name resolution, this will be inserted into the internal view. Override DNS resolution on the Pi \u00b6 You have likely noticed that when you run a dig query from your Pi, the query will not be sent to the resolver running on your Pi. Instead, by default, these queries are sent to the addresses provided to you by DHCP on your wireless network. This leads to a case where the hosts on your network can resolve .pi domains while the Pi itself cannot. We can easily override this behavior by modifying /etc/systemd/network/99-wlan.network to add a the localhost address as a static DNS location. While your Pi will still receive additional addresses from DHCP, your Pi will only use these as a fallback. The updated configuration is shown below. [Match] Name=wlan* [Network] DHCP=yes DNS=127.0.0.1 Important You will likely need to reboot your Pi before this new setting is respected. Public Services \u00b6 Use systemd-networkd to create and configure a persistent dummy interface on the Pi as described in the attached resources. This interface will represent the \"demilitarized-zone\" of your network within which you will host your public services. For each service, you will need to set up an IP from your public subnet within the DMZ. Follow the instructions provided in the Pi Mail repository to install Docker and configure the SMTP, IMAP, and Rainloop containers to serve email for your domain. Be sure to map each of these servers to a public IP address within your DMZ. Set up your Authoritatitive Name Server to listen on a public IP address within your DMZ. Update all records, e.g., MX and webmail, to point to the correct IP addresses based on your final network planning. Allow External DNS Queries \u00b6 At this point, we are expecting the Bind9 daemon to perform two different roles, acting as a recursive resolver and as an authoritative name server. While Bind9 is more than capable of performing both tasks, this can be a risky configuration. In particular, our authoritative server has to be open to everyone, but an unrestricted resolver is like a welcome mat for attackers who may attempt cache poisoning attacks and botnets that will use it to amplify DDoS attacks. In Checkpoint #4, we took steps to prevent these types of attacks by declaring an access control list (ACL) and using it to restrict which IP addresses are allowed to make recursive queries. The configuration appears in named.conf.options as follows: acl goodclients { localhost; 172.27.2.0/26; }; options { directory \"/var/cache/bind\"; recursion yes; allow-query { goodclients; }; ... In this configuration, your name server won't be able to receive a query outside of your own LAN. With a simple change to the last two lines, we can open up our name server to the outside world while still providing some basic security against misuse. allow-recursion { trusted; }; // change from `recursion yes;` allow-query { any; }; // change from `{ goodclients; };` Please be aware that we would look for stronger separation between these roles in a real-world scenario. At the very least, we might employ a feature of Bind9 called views . Or we could run multiple instances of Bind9 on separate IP addresses (or entirely separate servers). Making Improvements and Extra Credit \u00b6 Add an Anycast route to 10.10.10.10 and host a copy of the .pi top-level-domain Configure a private DNS zone, e.g., corp.gradebook.pi, and use BIND views to restrict access to your private zone and the DNS resolver so that it is not available outside of your local LAN. Configure policy-based routing to send all of your DNS traffic through the VPN (may be necessary if your ISP is messing with your DNS). Carefully perform hardening of your firewall rules to provide stronger security for your LAN and your router. Add a wireless access point to your Edge LANs. The wlan0 port is capable of operating as a software-based access point using the hostapd package in the Debian repositories. Firewall Rules \u00b6 Carefully perform hardening of your firewall rules to provide stronger security for your LAN and your router. Use the forward chain to prevent new connections into your LAN subnet from the routing link. In order for your users to access the rest of the Internet from your, you must still allow related/established connections back into your LAN. Carefully extend your Iptables rules to support a default DROP policy on the INPUT and OUTPUT chains, making sure that you have full utility of all of your private and public services. When experimenting with default policies on the INPUT or OUTPUT chain, you should ALWAYS use the iptables-apply command to test your rules and confirm that you are still able to create new SSH sessions. Make sure that you have written appropriate rules to accept traffic for authorized services, such as DHCP, SSH, and DNS, before changing the policy.

It will likely be helpful to review your previous work and the guides for the past Checkpoints (especially 1 - 4). The next task in store for you is to establish connectivity and routing to the ISP VM that your group configured earlier. This is a two-part process, as you will need to create a WireGuard interface and configure peering on both routers (Debian VM and Pi).

Configure a persistent keep-alive of 25 seconds in the WireGuard peer settings on the Pi. Enable the FRR BGP daemon and configure your new router based on the provided guides. In order to do this, you will need an ASN and an additional public address to use as a router ID. Make sure that both values are included in your documentation.

In Checkpoint #4, we took steps to prevent these types of attacks by declaring an access control list (ACL) and using it to restrict which IP addresses are allowed to make recursive queries.

We will not grant extensions for this type of incident. Before you begin to follow these instructions, make an external copy of critical configs such as wpa_supplicant using scp . We provide additional tips for rebuilding at the end of this guide. Systemd vs Default Networking \u00b6 By default, Raspberry Pi OS networking relies on a component called dhcpcd to manage interface settings, addresses, etc. While this component works well for general purpose computing, but it is not a match for every scenario. The current version of Debian (the base OS for Raspberry Pi OS) supports systemd based network management via the systemd-networkd service. Unlike dhcpcd , networkd is well-suited to managing the base configuration for our router. Enabling Networkd \u00b6 We will enable networkd in several steps. Try to complete this process in one sitting to avoid \"bricking\" your Pi (at least making it inaccessible over the network). Configure network interfaces \u00b6 To configure the network with networkd , we create files in /etc/systemd/network/ that match named network interfaces and define our desired settings settings. Create the following .network files to handle the default settings for wired and wireless interfaces. Enabling link local addresses is a critical component of these default configurations so that you can still communicate with the Pi when DHCP is not available. Warning Networkd configuration is generally easy to work with, but there are a couple of footguns to be aware of: The files are case sensitive and sometimes sensitive to seemingly innocuous changes in spacing. A file with a missing or invalid [Match] statement will be applied to every interface that hasn't already been matched by an earlier configuration. FAQ: Networkd configuration files man systemd.network provides a comprehensive reference to the format of the networkd configuration files and the process for loading them. At runtime, networkd gathers files using the .network extension from several locations, including /etc/systemd/network/ . To determine the order in which to apply configuration, networkd sorts all of these files lexically. To maintain proper control over execution order, we can prepend a two digit numeric value to the filename. This allows us to set up high-numbered default configurations that are overriden on a case-by-case basis by low-numberd configs files.

In our original configuration, we created a system-wide configuration file for wireless. This setup works just fine with the default networking setup, especially since the Pi is only equipped with one wireless interface by default. For networkd to work properly with wpa_supplicant , we need to attach our configuration directly to the wlan0 interface as shown below. # Rename configuration as a per-interface file sudo mv /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf # Enable the wpa_supplicant service specifically for wlan0 sudo systemctl enable wpa_supplicant@wlan0 # Disable the system-wide service sudo systemctl disable wpa_supplicant Test Your Configuration \u00b6 Call sudo reboot now to reboot the Pi.

The only way to debug at this point will be to attach a keyboard/monitor to the Pi or to mount the memory card from another Linux device or Virtual Machine. Rebuilding Raspberry Pi OS \u00b6 Alternatively, you may opt to reflash your memory card and repeat initial setup.

While we encourage you to search online and use other resources when you encounter questions, it's important that you follow our instructions closely. Though there are many different guides that can help you accomplish the same objectives, this guide has been built based on the needs and requirements of our projects and introduces you to tools you will need throughout the quarter. The core sections of this guide will walk you through the following steps: Install the Raspberry Pi OS on a microSD Enable SSH for headless management Set locale and other base configuration Configure wifi connections Update Raspberry Pi OS and installing additional packages with apt To complete these steps, you will need all of the following items: Computer running a recent desktop OS, such as: macOS 11+, Windows 10+, or a desktop Linux distribution Ethernet network interface (built-in or USB adapter) Media card reader supporting microSD (built-in or USB adapter) Unused 8GB+ microSD card (you may repurpose an existing card, but be aware that all contents will be wiped) Before you start setting up your Pi, please review the tasks in the following section. These steps are particularly important for students running Windows and Linux. Before you start \u00b6 Windows Users \u00b6 Enable the built-in OpenSSH Client \u00b6 All current versions of Windows 10 and 11 ship with an OpenSSH client, though the feature may be disabled by default. Follow the instructions here to enable this feature. Navigate to Settings -> Apps -> Optional features Click on Add an optional feature Enter OpenSSH and select the OpenSSH Client Click next to install Text Editor \u00b6 Among the many subtle differences between Windows and Unix-based machines is a difference in the control characters used to terminate lines in text files. In many cases, this difference will prevent Linux from parsing a file you've written and copied from Windows. To avoid this issue, install a code-oriented text editor that can be configured to use Unix-style line endings and use it exclusively for the labs and projects throughout this course. Visual Studio Code and Atom are common options. To configure VS Code to use Unix-style line endings: Open Settings Search for the term \u201cEol\u201d Change the default end of line character to \\n To configure Atom to use Unix-style line endings: Open Settings Navigate to Packages / Line Ending Selector Change the Default line ending to LF Terminal \u00b6 Except when otherwise noted, I recommend that Windows users complete all Linux networking exercises within Windows PowerShell rather than Git Bash or the Command Prompt. Info For a much improved working experience, you should use the new Windows Terminal application. Terminal is available in the Microsoft Store for Windows 10 users and it is shipped pre-installed with Windows 11. By default, the terminal will run PowerShell, but it also supports Command Prompt and Windows Subsystem for Linux. Linux Users \u00b6 Using your default package manager (likely yum or apt ), confirm that Avahi mDNS services are installed (mDNS is typically part of the default distribution). Install Raspberry Pi OS \u00b6 The Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer built with Linux distributions in mind. The official operating system, which we'll use in our labs is known as Raspberry Pi OS and is based on Debian Linux. If you're familiar with Ubuntu or Arch Linux, you should be mostly at home working in Raspberry Pi OS. Don't worry if Linux is not your jam. We'll provide plenty of guidance so that you can focus your energy on network concepts. Write Raspberry Pi OS to MicroSD \u00b6 Download the Raspberry Pi Imager from https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ and launch the software Click the button labeled CHOOSE OS Select Raspberry Pi OS (other) and scroll down to find Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) Insert a microSD card into your card reader and proceed with the install. Unlike the full version of the operating system, Raspberry Pi OS Lite is completely text-based and is well-suited for headless operation. There isn't a graphical desktop environment, but you won't need it. All of projects in this course will be completed in a remote command-line interface (CLI). Update Configuration \u00b6 Etcher will eject the microSD once the image is completely rewritten. We want to edit some files on the SD, so you will need to briefly remove the card before inserting it again. On macOS or Windows, you'll be limited to accessing the boot partition of the card. Use Explorer or Finder to locate and open the partition. You must complete the following step before the first boot. Enable SSH \u00b6 Due to security considerations, the newest versions of Raspian disable SSH by default, but it's easy to turn the feature on so that we can connect to the Pi without requiring a monitor and keyboard. To enable SSH on the first boot, add an empty file named ssh to the boot volume. There are many ways to create this file. If you want to use the command-line, follow the instructions below (macOS and Windows): macOS Windows # Unix-based systems mount external storage to a path in the directory tree. For a freshly written Raspberry Pi OS image, this path will be /Volumes/boot. touch /Volumes/boot/ssh # Windows mounts external storage to a drive letter. Replace E: with the letter assigned on your system. New-Item -type File E :\\ ssh Raspberry Pi OS checks for /boot/ssh during startup. When present, the OS enables the OpenSSH daemon and deletes the file. Information Daemon is a computing term used to describe software that runs in the background, e.g., to provide a service for network-based clients. The term is most commonly associated with Unix-flavored operating systems. Initial Boot \u00b6 It's time to boot the Pi for the first time. Close your editor and any windows that are open to the microSD so that you can eject the card gracefully from your OS. Remove the microSD and insert into the card slot on your Pi. Connect power to the designated micro-USB port. Attach to your computer with an Ethernet cable and get ready to launch an SSH connection. From terminal or PowerShell, connect to the Pi for the first time by running the following command: # The default password for pi is raspberry ssh pi@raspberrypi.local This command directs your local SSH client to connect to a network host named raspberrypi.local with the username pi . Since you haven't connected to this device before, SSH should ask you to accept the connection of an unknown device before presenting you with a password prompt. Information Before the SSH client can initiate it's connection to the Pi, it must find the IP address associated with raspberrypi.local . This process is called resolution and will be completed using a protocol known as multicast DNS (mDNS). $ ssh pi@raspberrypi.local The authenticity of host 'raspberrypi.local (fe80::1b9c:bcf2:acd6:bbbe%42)' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:QqhpMybvctuIxV03xcnlANU3cxWM1JhvSYxloSd69Rw. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? If you had previously connected to a different host with the name raspberrypi.local , you may also see the warning shown below (please refer to the troubleshooting section to resolve this error): @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ @ WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! @ @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY! After confirming the prompt shown above, you will see another short message followed by a password prompt.

Use raspi-config to set the country before use. pi@raspberrypi:~ $ Choose a New Password \u00b6 Before proceeding further with setup, you should change the default password by entering the passwd at the command prompt. You will be guided through three prompts to enter the current password and then to update/confirm the new password. Danger SSH is a favorite target of malicious attackers. Nothing makes their lives easier than devices that are configured with the default password for the type of system. Default Configuration \u00b6 Several additional steps are required to prepare your Pi for future projects. While some of these steps may not seem essential, omitting them might pose consequences when trying to troubleshoot problems later in the course. Setting the timezone will ensure that log messages are displayed in local time, which is quite helpful for troubleshooting. # You can see a list of timezones by running `timedatectl list-timezones` sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Los_Angeles Raspberry Pi OS defaults to a British locale. This can cause issues if we ever need to troubleshoot your device using an external keyboard. Configure the locale and keymap to prevent these issues. # Update /etc/locale.gen with your preferences sudo nano /etc/locale.gen # Find and uncomment the en_US.UTF-8 locale # Re-generate locale information after updating the locale.gen file sudo locale-gen # Apply new settings sudo localectl set-locale \"LANG=en_US.UTF-8\" sudo localectl set-keymap us Occasionally we'll end up running a program that uses the default editor settings for your profile (or root if we have run the program with sudo ). It's helpful to have these configured so that you don't end up stuck in vi or ed without any way to exit. # Update default editor selections for the pi user select-editor # Modify the same setting for commands that require root privileges. sudo select-editor Retain Logs Between Boots \u00b6 In recent versions of Raspberry Pi OS, system logs are collected by the journald service. In the default configuration, logs are not retained between reboots of your Pi. To ensure that logs are available when you need to debug, you can enable log retention by running the following commands. # Create the location for persistent log messages sudo mkdir -p /var/log/journal sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /var/log/journal Update Hostname \u00b6 At first boot, we could locate our Pi on the network based on the default hostname of raspberrypi.local . This is fine in an isolated, point-to-point network, but it's a problem when we connect to shared networks. Use the hostnamectl command to set a unique name for your device. # This little pi likes to be called Titan sudo hostnamectl set-hostname titan The main change that hostnamectl makes is visible in /etc/hostname . We also need to update references to the hostname in /etc/hosts . The hosts file is present on most Operating Systems and provides a way of defining hostname/IP address associations without relying on DNS. Linux uses this file to associate your hostname to the loopback IP address. # Confirm your hostname is up to date in /etc/hostname cat /etc/hostname # Replace any references to raspberrypi in /etc/hosts sudo nano /etc/hosts FAQ: Why is sudo slow You might notice odd warnings and sudo latency immediately after changing the hostname. These should clear up once you update the hosts file . For reasons beyond the scope of this curriculum, sudo performs DNS lookups as part of its check to determine whether the current user is permitted to elevate privileges. The delay you experience is the tool waiting for a DNS response prior to its timeout. In order for the hostname changes to take full effect, reboot your pi by calling sudo reboot now . After 20 - 30 seconds your pi will be visible with the new name -- you will need to include the .local suffix on any command referencing the name. Example # ping by mDNS hostname ping titan.local # ssh by mDNS hostname ssh pi@titan.local Enable Passwordless Login \u00b6 We can significantly simplify the process of managing our Pi\u2019s by copying our public SSH keys into the authorized_keys file of the default pi user. To prepare the Raspberry Pi, we need to create a remote directory under the pi user's home directory. If you're still logged into your pi, you can create the directory using mkdir ~/.ssh . After that is done, type exit to terminate the connection and return to your local command prompt. FAQ: Why aren't ssh and scp working Please review the previous set of instructions closely. The commands below are run from your local shell. Running them inside of an existing SSH session will not have the effect you are looking for. With the directory in place, copy your public key (most likely ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ) to the pi using the scp command. scp $HOME /.ssh/id_ed25519.pub pi@raspberrypi.local:.ssh/authorized_keys Info The second set of parameters in this command specifies the user ( pi ) the host ( titan.local ) and the location of the new file ( .ssh/authorized_keys ). Like ssh , scp is a user-based tool and will be executed relative to the home directory of the authenticated user ( /home/pi ). We can override the default by specifying an absolute path beginning with a / , e.g., /home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys . Connect to Wifi \u00b6 To complete this guide, you will need to establish Internet connectivity for your Pi. Since the Pi 4 has integrated wireless capabilities, we can solve the problem by connecting to local wifi. Set the Wireless Network Locale \u00b6 Wireless networks operate in radio frequency (RF) ranges that are subject to regulation in the geographic region that the network is operated. Before turning on the wireless features of your Raspberry Pi, set the regulatory domain to the United States. There are several ways to modify wireless settings on your Pi. For now, we'll use the wpa_cli command to interactively modify the settings. # Launch wpa_cli interactively wpa_cli -i wlan0 # Enter the following commands at the wpa_cli prompt get country # Returns two letter code for current setting regulatory domain set country US # Returns OK save_config # Returns OK quit Enable the Wireless Interface \u00b6 Recent versions of the operating system use a system feature named rfkill to disable the WiFi radio by default. Before you can connect to any networks, you'll need to remove this block. sudo rfkill unblock wlan Configure the WPA Supplicant \u00b6 Wireless settings for the Pi are controlled by a service called wpa_supplicant , which stores network connection settings inside /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf . You already saw an example of modifying these settings through wpa_cli . For the following task, I recommend that you edit the file directly in a text editor of your choice. Before you make any changes, take a look at the default configuration by running sudo cat /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf (sudo is required since this file is only readable to root). You should see something like this: country=US ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev update_config=1 If you are editing the file on your own computer, paste these lines at the top of the file and add the rest of your changes below them. You will be adding a network definition for each WLAN that you want to use. Detailed configuration instructions are available in WPA Supplicant Configuration Reference . For this project, use the configuration reference to set up the following networks: Eduroam (w/ Certificate Based Authentication) (Optional) UW MPSK Network Requires Device Registration (Optional) Home Network Testing Wireless Connections \u00b6 When you are finished updating wpa_supplicant.conf reconfigure the wireless interface by calling wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure . The command should return OK after a few seconds. Check that you are attached to the wireless network by calling wpa_cli -i wlan0 status . Information You previously ran the wpa_cli tool in interactive mode. The instructions above pass individual commands and return you directly to the Linux command prompt. This method is quick and convenient, but if you run into problems, interactive mode will provide the most information for debugging purposes.

As a Debian based Linux distribution, Raspberry Pi OS relies on apt for package management. The apt update command is used to determine whether there are new packages to download. sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade sudo apt dist-upgrade # We've found that an additional update is sometimes needed after a dist-upgrade sudo apt update # Install some useful packages while you're at it sudo apt install dnsutils Graceful Shutdown \u00b6 Never yank the power from your Pi when it's time to quit. This can lead to data corruption on the microSD (they aren't as resilient as the drives installed in your laptop). Instead, you should always issue a proper shutdown via SSH. From an SSH connection, run sudo poweroff . If you ever need to reboot the Pi, call sudo reboot now . Wait about 15 - 20 seconds to allow the Pi to complete it\u2019s shutdown process before disconnecting the power. Tips and Troubleshooting \u00b6 Can't find raspberrypi.local \u00b6 If you can't make an initial connection to the Raspberry Pi, verify the following requirements were satisfied: Raspberry Pi OS has been successfully written to microSD card Test again with a known good SD card OpenSSH daemon was enabled before booting the Pi[^ssh_gone] Physical connection is healthy Make sure that both ends of the cable are completely inserted Try an alternate cable, or test the cable with another device Network interface is functional Check for link lights on both network interfaces Verify that your network adapter is visible to the OS Determine whether your network adapter requires drivers Network interface is assigned a link local address Current system configuration supports multicast DNS (mDNS) [^ssh_gone] Raspberry Pi OS will remove the /boot/ssh file after enabling the service. You do not need to restore the file if you find that it has disappeared. Missing Network Drivers \u00b6 If you are using a USB Ethernet port for the first time on your computer, it's possible that your first attempt to connect will be unsuccessful. Some issues are resolved simply by disconnecting the USB briefly and trying to connect again after you have plugged everything back in. If your issues persist, check the manufacturer's support page or search to determine whether your computer needs additional drivers for the specific model of Ethernet adapter. If drivers are necessary, they will usually be available from the manufacturer's website. Link Local Addresses \u00b6 Run ipconfig on Windows or ifconfig on other devices to confirm that the interface registers a network connection. The local IPv4 address for this interface should begin with 169.254.x.x (link-local address range). Most devices will assign this type of address automatically if a DHCP cannot be found. Linux Some versions of Linux, e.g., Ubuntu, require you to choose between link-local addressing and DHCP. Explore your advanced adapter settings for Ethernet to change the adapter settings. Multicast DNS \u00b6 Windows Make sure that you are on a recent build of Windows 10 or Windows 11. Though mDNS is now a draft standard, Microsoft did not include a full client until late 2018. Support for mDNS on earlier versions of Windows relied on the Bonjour Print Services software that was once distributed by Apple in conjunction with iTunes and various other applications. Linux Desktop Linux distributions often support mDNS resolution using the Avahi daemon. Review the requirements at the beginning of this guide . SSH Connection Warning \u00b6 At some point, you are likely to receive the following warning when trying to launch ssh . In most cases, what you are seeing is expected behavior. @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ @ WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! @ @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY! The first time you connect to a host, SSH will bind a cryptographic signature to the hostname, e.g., raspberrypi.local and store it within ~/.ssh/known_hosts . To prevent attacks, SSH warns us when the signature changes for a known host. In our case, it's likely that there is another explanation for the mismatched signature since SSH will create a new private key every time we set up or rebuild a Raspberry Pi. Since this is not an attack scenario, resolve the conflict with ssh-keygen -R raspberrypi.local , which will remove the existing entry. Missing features in Windows SSH The ssh-keygen -R feature isn't present before Windows 10 1809. If you are still running an older version of Windows, you will have to locate known_hosts within the .ssh configuration directory and remove the line indicated by the warning message. Wireless Network is Disabled \u00b6 Check the state of your wireless network interface using the rfkill list . If a soft-block is listed for wlan0 , it's likely that you skipped one or more previous steps. Double-check your wireless locale and use rfkill to enable your interface . Permission Denied Errors \u00b6 When we're performing system and network administration, we are often in need of root privileges. Running an administrative command without the appropriate privileges will result in a permissions-related error. By default, the pi user is restricted in which parts of the system it can read and modify (Linux is heavily user-based in it's permissions model); however, the user is permitted to elevate itself to the admin level with sudo when it is necessary to perform privileged commands. As a general security precaution, don't sudo commands unless it's necessary. For now, we'll indicate when that's the case. In later tasks, you will need to make this determination on your own.","title":"Raspberry Pi Setup"},{"location":"assignments/pi-setup/#raspberry-pi-setup-guide-2022-03-29","text":"","title":"Raspberry Pi Setup Guide (2022-03-29)"},{"location":"assignments/pi-setup/#overview","text":"This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to install Raspberry Pi OS on your Pi and connect it to Wifi.

These encodings are simple to work with, but they are quite limited in the size of alphabet that they can support. The advantage of multi-byte encodings, such as those defined by the Unicode standard, is the ability to represent different languages, alphabets, and sets of symbols within the application. One of the most common encodings in modern applications is UTF-8, a variable-length encoding that provides backwards compatibility with ASCII while also supporting multi-byte encodings required for broad Unicode compatibility.

This new functionality will take the place of the public DNS resolvers we used in the previous assignments (e.g., 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8 ). Important With each checkpoint, we expect you to do more of the work on your own. While the initial Pi setup gave clear instructions, we are slowly moving toward giving you specifications and additional context that you need in order to determine the right steps to accomplish the task. In this assignment, you will use an existing tutorial as a reference to help you complete the project specifications. Please note that you will not follow the tutorial verbatim, but instead make adjustments based on the project requirements. For some students, this can be a challenging adjustment, but it is also a valuable skill to learn and practice as you prepare for technical internships and jobs. Before you start \u00b6 Before you begin, make sure that you have completed all steps through Checkpoint #3 successfully. At this point, your Pi should operate as a NAT-router between the Ethernet LAN and a Wifi-based WAN. Likewise, DHCP is configured to provide LAN clients with a full network configuration, including a default gateway and a public DNS resolver. At times in this project, you will need to refer back to the configuration you defined in the previous LAN Planning Exercise . Instructions \u00b6 Review/Update your IP Address Plan \u00b6 Since we will be running our DNS resolver inside our LAN, we will need to provide it with an IP address on eth0 . Choose an unused static address from the ranges you defined in your initial LAN Planning. Before you can assign this address to a service, you will need to add another Address= line to your eth0 configuration in systemd-networkd . Further instructions were provided in Checkpoint #2 . While it may not be clear at this point, there are sometimes benefits to using separate addresses for diffferent services (in real-world scenarios) even though they're all running on the same device and network interface. The first benefit that comes to my mind is that planning for multiple addresses sets you up for easy changes to your network architecture in the future. It might make sense to combine all of these services onto one device today, but that might not always be the case depending on your requirements. Install BIND on the router \u00b6 BIND (also refered to as named ) is a robust and versatile DNS implementation developed by the Internet Services Consortium (ISC) -- the same folks that developed the DHCP server implementation we have deployed. The first version of BIND was released in 1986. At present, BIND 9 is the most widely deployed DNS server on the Internet. BIND and related utilities are packaged in the Debian/Raspbian software repositories, meaning that they can be installed and managed easily with the apt utilities that we are already familiar with. For our purposes, we want to install three different packages named bind9 , bind9utils , bind9-doc . Please refer to previous guides if you need to review the options for the apt command. Configure BIND as a caching DNS server \u00b6 The term DNS server can refer to several distinct roles that are defined in the DNS specifications 1 . BIND can be configured to operate in all of these roles, but in this checkpoint, we want to configure the service to handle recursive DNS resolution for our LAN clients. Until now, our clients relied on public DNS services. To accomplish this objective, refer to the section of Digital Ocean's tutorial 2 , which demonstrates how to set up a caching DNS server (be sure to stop after this section) and the notes below. You will need to make several adjustments to the configuration you created based on DO's guidance: Confirm that you have adapted the instructions to use your own IP address ranges. Disable IPv6 by changing listen-on-v6 { any; }; to listen-on-v6 { none; }; . Limit which IPv4 addresses will be listening for DNS queries by setting listen-on { 127.0.0.1; <DNS IP>; } . <DNS IP> will be replaced by the static IP on which you want to respond to DNS requests If the listen-on block is missing from the original file, you can add it immediately before or after listen-on-v6 . 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address. We're including this for times that your Pi will query its own resolver. Restrict the acl to include localhost and your own subnet range (CIDR format) If you added localnets while following the tutorial, remove it now. This setting would allow the resolver to be accessed on the external (wireless network) as well as your LAN. If you're curious to learn more about this security precaution, read up on Cache Poisoning Attacks or hit us up in office hours. Disable DNSSEC functionality by replacing the configuration line that reads dnssec-validation auto; with dnssec-enable no; . Disabling DNSSEC is necessary due to the limitations of using a Pi versus an always on network server. Specifically, the inability of the Pi to maintain accurate time when it is powered off interferes with the verification process for DNSSEC cryptographic signatures Test and verify that the new server is operating properly \u00b6 In addition to the troubleshooting tools that we're already familiar with. BIND comes with a utility called named-checkconf that will review its core configuration files for syntax errors. You should run it any time you modify the BIND configuration in this assignment or future checkpoints. Why didn't named-checkconf do anything If it doesn't find any syntax errors in your configuration files, named-checkconf will return without displaying any messages. To see what sort of errors are reported by the utility, create an intentional syntax error and run the tool again.

Until now, our clients relied on public DNS services. To accomplish this objective, refer to the section of Digital Ocean's tutorial 2 , which demonstrates how to set up a caching DNS server (be sure to stop after this section) and the notes below. You will need to make several adjustments to the configuration you created based on DO's guidance: Confirm that you have adapted the instructions to use your own IP address ranges. Disable IPv6 by changing listen-on-v6 { any; }; to listen-on-v6 { none; }; . Limit which IPv4 addresses will be listening for DNS queries by setting listen-on { 127.0.0.1; <DNS IP>; } . <DNS IP> will be replaced by the static IP on which you want to respond to DNS requests If the listen-on block is missing from the original file, you can add it immediately before or after listen-on-v6 . 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address. We're including this for times that your Pi will query its own resolver. Restrict the acl to include localhost and your own subnet range (CIDR format) If you added localnets while following the tutorial, remove it now. This setting would allow the resolver to be accessed on the external (wireless network) as well as your LAN. If you're curious to learn more about this security precaution, read up on Cache Poisoning Attacks or hit us up in office hours. Disable DNSSEC functionality by replacing the configuration line that reads dnssec-validation auto; with dnssec-enable no; .

Note With each checkpoint, we expect you to do more of the work on your own. While the initial Pi setup gave clear instructions, we are slowly moving toward giving you specifications and additional context that you need in order to determine the right steps to accomplish the task. Before you Start \u00b6 Before you begin, make sure that you have completed all steps from Checkpoints #1 and #2 successfully. By now, your pi should be able to connect to the Internet via wireless, and it should provide DHCP services via a pre-defined address range on the ethernet-based LAN. At times in this project, you will need to refer back to the configuration you defined in the previous LAN Planning Exercise . Objectives \u00b6 In this assignment, you will be configuring the Pi as a simple Internet gateway that routes traffic between an isolated, wired LAN and an Internet-connected wireless network. Practically speaking, you'll be tethering your computer to the Pi and using it to access the rest of the Internet. Whether it is immediately obvious or not, this architecture has practical applications. It is not always a good idea to connect your computer directly to an untrusted network. With a few more components, the Pi provides a simple firewall that can protect against many types of threats. Further, the Pi can be used to tunnel your traffic through a personal VPN, ensuring that that it cannot be intercepted or tampered with on a public network or local ISP. Project outline \u00b6 The main steps of this project are listed below: Configure basic firewall rules and NAT Enable packet forwarding settings within Raspberry Pi OS Update DHCP to provide gateway and DNS settings Test and troubleshoot your configuration Overview of NAT \u00b6 The hosts in our network use RFC-1918 addresses, which are restricted to private networks and cannot be used as a source or destination for addresses on packets being sent over the Internet. We'll address this problem with network address translation (NAT) , which will allow your Pi to communicate on the Internet by masquerading with the public address assigned to the WAN port of the router. This setup is a special case of source NAT in that many private IP addresses will be mapped to one public address on the external interface. To accommodate, the Pi will need to monitor the state of each connection and other network traffic so that it can route to the correct host on the internal network when incoming traffic is received. Configuring NAT \u00b6 NAT functionality is supported natively in Linux through the netfilter firewall and can be managed through a framework known as nftables by defining rules that filter and manipulate packets. Attention Throughout the instructions, we'll refer to the wired interface as <LAN> (because it serves our local network) and the wireless interface as the <WAN> (because it connects us to the Internet). Your configuration files will reflect the OS-assigned interface names, such as: eth0 and wlan0 . We have prepared an nftables tutorial that focuses specifically on the features that are required to implement NAT . Read this tutorial carefully before you attempt to configure nftables on your Pi. Rule Specification \u00b6 The previous guide contains a template and partial ruleset to help you enable NAT and restrict traffic forwarded between networks. Save a copy of this template in the home directory of your Pi and fill in the missing values so that it complies with the following requirements: Create a table named filter with a base chain named forward that is attached to the filter / forward hook. Use a default policy to drop packets on the forward chain unless they're explicitly allowed by another rule. Include a rule to allow all outbound packets on the forward chain. Include a rule to allow inbound packets on the forward chain if they are related to previous packets or established connections. Create a table named nat with a base chain named postrouting that is attached to the nat / postrouting hook. Include a rule to masquerade the addresses for outbound packets on the <WAN> interface. Testing and Applying Rules \u00b6 After you finish filling in the missing values in the reference template according to the above specifications, follow the instructions in the provided tutorial to test your rules and load them at boot. You will not be able to completely test your rules until you complete upcoming steps. What you should ensure at this point is that the rules are applied and that you are not locked out of the Pi. Enable Packet Forwarding \u00b6 With your nftables configuration in place, you are ready to enable forwarding within the OS. By default, the Linux networking stack accepts packets with its own IP addresses and discards everything else. This behavior can be changed through the sysctl service, enabling the network stack to forward packets that are destined for nodes on another network. To turn on IPv4 forwarding when the system boots, add a new file named /etc/sysctl.d/10-forward_ip4.conf containing net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 . After saving this file, call sudo sysctl -p --system . Update DHCP Configuration \u00b6 Update the DHCP configuration written in the previous assignment to provide clients with settings for a default router and a public DNS resolver (called domain name servers in isc-dhcp-server ). Use the examples provided in the default dhcpd.conf as the basis for your changes. Restart isc-dhcp-server in order to load the new configuration. Renew your DHCP lease by temporarily disconnecting Ethernet or following instructions provided in the resources section of this site. Test your Configuration \u00b6 Once you have completed these changes, you should be able to access external networks by way of the Raspberry Pi. Disable wireless networking and other network interfaces on your laptop so that the Pi is your only route to the Internet. Try connecting to a well-known website from your browser. From your laptop's command line, use the traceroute command ( tracert on Windows) to confirm that your Pi is the first hop of this route. Troubleshooting \u00b6 If you run into problems here, there are a few points to check. First, try to ping a known address such as 1.1.1.1 from your computer. This will tell you whether or not you have connectivity outside your network. If you're at UW, try pinging 128.95.112.1, to determine whether you can access hosts on campus. You may also try pinging a known domain name like amazon.com (and washington.edu if you're on campus). If you can't ping anything, you may have an issue with the network configuration on your computer. Try pinging the static address you created for the Pi. If this fails with no route to host, go back and make sure you set up the Pi and your computer correctly. If you can ping by IP address, but not name, you have an issue with DNS. Verify that DHCP is providing a valid name server address. If you're able to ping your Pi by it's IP and you're certain that you've set up your local network correctly, go back and confirm that the Pi has forwarding enabled for IP and that your iptables rules are loading.","title":"Router Setup"},{"location":"assignments/router-setup/#build-a-nat-enabled-router","text":"","title":"Build a NAT - enabled Router"},{"location":"assignments/router-setup/#overview","text":"This assignment builds on the DHCP server functionality you set up in the previous project.

The routing topology that you will be working with in this challenge is representative of the topology used in our final, group project. In this topology, we have three autonomous systems, i.e., networks that are managed independently from one another. Each of our three routers serves a group of local users via a LAN segment in addition to being connected to external networks via point-to-point routing links. The network positioned at the top of the diagram will function as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) for the other networks networks, routing traffic between them and other groups within the class. The links between routers are known as routing links. Each one represents a separate point-to-point network over which the routers will forward messages and share information about the inter-network topology. Instructions \u00b6 Identify broadcast domains \u00b6 Identify the distinct broadcast domains in the system and assign a different VLAN label (between 2 and 4094) to each of these network segments. Define physical connections \u00b6 Assign each physical connection to a port on the switch. Since the topology is determined by port configuration, you will need to keep track of which device and network interface is associated with each port. Choose an order that is easy to remember. Create port configurations \u00b6 Once you have identified the VLANs and mapped ports to physical topology, you can begin to define the port configurations. For each port, you will define a native VLAN (untagged) and zero or more tagged VLANs. A port can have both types of VLANs associated with it, though there can only be one native VLAN configured for any port. Untagged ethernet frames received on a port will be mapped internally to the native VLAN of the port and can only be forwarded (or flooded) through links attached to ports that are configured with the same VLAN (tagged or untagged). When a VLAN is configured to be tagged on a specific port, that port will add a VLAN identifier to outgoing frames and read/remove the identifiers from incoming frames. Adding a tagged VLAN to a port creates a trunk. Trunk links expect the same tag configuration on both ends of the link, i.e., they require explicit configuration on both sides of the trunk. Ports without any tagged VLANs are called access ports. These are preferred for most applications since the VLAN configuration will be encapsulated within the switch and transparent to users. LAN connections \u00b6 For simplicity, start the process by defining the port configurations for a single broadcast domain associated with one of the LANs in the topology, e.g., LAN A. Pay close attention to the requirements given in the next section, which state that LAN connections to A, B, and C should be accessible without tagging. Routing links \u00b6 Once you have completed the configuration for independent LANs, turn your attention to the routing links between the LANs. Update the configuration for each side of the routing link (two physical ports) with the appropriate VLAN configurations. Uplink \u00b6 Finally, turn your attention to the connection that forms the uplink to the core network for the class. The uplink is a routing link, and it is configured in much the same manner as the other routing links in our topology. However, pay close attention to the assignment specifications and the implications for the final port configuration. Specifications \u00b6 In addition to the following the given network layer topology, please align your VLAN strategy with requirements below: Layer-3 Network Diagram Example Physical Diagram Access links to general LANs \u00b6 LANs A, B, and C are general purpose networks and should be exposed as untagged VLANs. This enables us to alternate seamlessly between a direct connect from our laptop to Pi and a connection that runs through the switch. If we were to rely on tagged VLANs to access a given LAN, you would need to configure VLANs on your laptop in order to connect directly to the Pi. Tagged Routing Links \u00b6 Routing links may rely on tagged VLANs. The router will connect to these VLANs via virtual network interfaces that are configured to exchange tagged Ethernet traffic rather than standard, untagged frames. The router side of this configuration is beyond the scope of this exercise. Untagged Uplink Connection \u00b6 The remote end of the uplink connection will be untagged. Make sure that you configure the associated port accordingly. Eliminate Extraneous Connections \u00b6 For each port, only expose the VLANs that are necessary to satisfy the routing requirements indicated in the diagram. Adding additional VLANs creates unintended paths for communication, e.g., allowing Laptop A to communicate directly with Laptop B. For the purposes of this assignment, treat this sort of unintended pathway as a security exposure.","title":"VLAN Challenge (last edited 2020-02-06)"},{"location":"assignments/vlan-challenge/#vlan-challenge-last-edited-2020-02-06","text":"","title":"VLAN Challenge (last edited 2020-02-06)"},{"location":"assignments/vlan-challenge/#overview","text":"The objective of this assignment is to determine a VLAN strategy and port configuration that overlays the given routing topology onto a managed 8-port switch.

Introduction to Wireshark \u00b6 Wireshark is a tool designed to record and observe the messages that are sent over a network and to provide an analyst with tools to understand and troubleshoot the protocols associated with those messages. Starting a Capture \u00b6 Open Wireshark and locate the Capture section of the launch screen. This section contains an input field for configuring capture filters and a list of physical and virtual interfaces that can be used to capture packets. To the right of each interface, you should notice an animated \u201csparkline\u201d which indicates the level of activity on the associated network. You can launch a capture on your active interface (likely Wi-Fi or Ethernet) by double-clicking on the respective label. If a capture filter was specified before you selected the interface, Wireshark ignores any packets that don't match the filter. If the filter input is empty, Wireshark records everything it sees on the wire. Recording continues until you press the stop icon in the top toolbar or close the application. Exploring a Capture \u00b6 By default, Wireshark will divide capture-related content among three panes: Packet List Packet Details Packet Bytes The Packet List displays all packets in the current capture, summarizing important details about traffic flow and the type of data contained in the packet. The Packet Details view initially displays a layered summary of the protocols represented in the selected packet. A more detailed view of each protocol can be explored by clicking the arrow icons to the left of the summary. The order of the protocols in this view corresponds to the order in which each protocol\u2019s header appears in the data frame. The Packet Bytes pane can be useful for understanding the basic structure of raw network messages. As you navigate through the details in this view, Wireshark will highlight the corresponding bytes in the Packet Bytes pane. Narrowing your Search \u00b6 If you have any software, particularly a web browser, running in the background, you'll notice that Wireshark can quickly accumulate a large list of packets. Fortunately, the software provides a variety of tools to help you more easily locate packets relevant to your search. The packet list can be modified non-destructively by adding/removing display filters 1 in the input field below the top toolbar. Display filters are a valuable analytic tool that allows you to remove noise and quickly focus on packets that match certain criteria. In addition to writing your own display filters, you can access a variety of context-specific analysis tools by right clicking on any row of the Packet List or a field within the Packet Details pane. These tools can help you create a display filter based on the current packet or to investigate a conversation that spans multiple packets. Instructions \u00b6 DHCP \u00b6 Setup \u00b6 Stop any ongoing captures and configure a new capture on your wireless interface with capture filter arp || udp portrange 67-68 . This filter will prevent Wireshark from capturing excessive amounts of traffic so that we can leave the capture running for the entire lab. While our current capture should be fairly quiet owing to the previous capture filter, create a display filter to further reduce the number of visible packets (Hint: Type dhcp into the display filter input below the main wireshark toolbar). At the end of the lab, save your capture and submit it with your assignment. Request a new DHCP Lease \u00b6 In order to properly complete this lab, you will need to terminate your current DHCP lease so that you can capture the process of DHCP initializing your network interface. This process will differ depending on your OS. Follow the instructions linked on the resources site to complete this process. Report \u00b6 Based on your capture, create an outline of your complete DHCP exchange. For each message: Include a screenshot of the packet details summary. Include a brief written summary, identifying: DHCP message type, DHCP transaction ID, source and destination Ethernet addresses, source and destination IP addresses, and UDP source and destination UDP ports associated. How can you determine which messages were sent by your own device versus the DHCP server? Based on the outline you created above, determine the purpose of the 0.0.0.0 address appearing within the DHCP exchange. What Ethernet-layer (Layer 2) address corresponds to the 255.255.255.255 (Layer 3) IP address? Using online resources as necessary, determine the purpose of these special addresses. Which of the fields that you have observed can be used to distinguish between different conversations between the same client and server? If you look closely at the packet details for each message, you'll notice that each DHCP message contains a variety of options. In DHCP, options allow DHCP clients and servers to adapt the protocol to their own needs. Like many other protocols, DHCP encodes options as a type , a length , and a value . Based on this structure, we can continue to extend the protocol without needing to change the basic foundation. Using your search engine of choice, identify the IETF RFC (# and name) that defines the common option types for the DHCP protocol. Which DHCP Option (#) tells us the DHCP message type? How many bytes are required to encode the type? Which DHCP Option (#) tells us the length of a DHCP lease? How many bytes are required to encode the duration of the lease? According to the RFC, is it possible to specify the lease length in any unit of time other than seconds? Compare the Lease Time option of the Discover message with the value in the Offer message. Did your device request a particular duration? If so, did the server honor this request? Using online resources as needed, determine what happens at the end of a DHCP address lease. Based on the order of the messages in the capture and the details we've asked you to examine, offer an explanation of how the DHCP protocol works to configure your network interface with appropriate settings. How does the protocol make use of Ethernet and IP broadcast functionality, and why is that important? Use your capture to illustrate your point. ARP \u00b6 Setup \u00b6 You may continue to use the same capture for this section. If you launch a new capture, please save the first capture and submit both with your assignment. Before you begin the analysis questions, clear the ARP cache per instructions linked on the resources site and generate some Internet traffic, e.g., browse the web. Remove any existing display filters and create a new filter that will only show ARP related traffic. (Hint: type arp in the display filter input). Report \u00b6 Outline a complete ARP exchange (request and response). For each message: Include a screenshot of the packet details summary. Include a brief written summary, identifying: ARP Opcode, Sender and Target Ethernet addresses, Sender and Target IP addresses. Identify the 48-bit hardware address associated with your network interface and use this information to specify which message(s) originated from your local device? Determine which messages are sent to a broadcast destination. Why do you think the ARP protocol makes use of the broadcast destination? Aside from the broadcast address, what other differences do you notice between the contents of ARP requests and replies? Spend a moment comparing the overall packet structure (as seen in the Packet Details view) between DHCP and ARP. Identify any layers that are present in one protocol but not in the other. In order for a network message to be considered an IP packet, the message must contain an Internet Protocol layer that includes an IP header for the rest of the message. Does the ARP protocol use IP packets to communicate? Describe in your own words how ARP works to allow hosts to communicate in a Layer-2 network based on IP address. Use your capture to illustrate your points. Do not confuse display filters and capture filters. They serve very different purposes and even use distinct syntax. \u21a9","title":"Lab 1 - Analyzing DHCP and ARP with Wireshark"},{"location":"assignments/wireshark01/#analyzing-dhcp-and-arp-with-wireshark","text":"Lab 1 Assignment page on Canvas","title":"Analyzing DHCP and ARP with Wireshark"},{"location":"assignments/wireshark01/#overview","text":"The purpose of this lab is for students to get familiar with basic functionalities of Wireshark, and to be able to capture and analyze network traffic.

By the end of the lab you will be familiar with: dig (or PowerShell's Resolve-DnsName command) DNS queries security faults of DNS We highly recommend using search engines to help you find solutions. As usual, there will be multiple ways to complete this lab. Please use the template provided on Canvas under the Assignment \"Lab 2 - Analyze DNS & HTTP in Wireshark\" to complete your lab report. Part I - website \u00b6 Pick a popular website that has a lot of content on it. Ideally it should contain advertisements. You will be using it throughout this lab. Report : What website did you select? Part II - dig \u00b6 Before jumping into more complicated scenarios we would like you to learn how to use the dig command as it is an incredibly helpful and simple tool. We've provided some resources at Perform DNS Loookups Manually to help you get started. Use dig to lookup the domain name of the website you selected. Open up a new tab in your browser and enter (one of) the IP address(es) returned by dig to discover where it will take you. If dig returned more than one address, open up a second tab and enter it now. Note Don't panic if you receive an error instead of a live site. Some servers host more than one website and need the name to help route you to the right place. Try another site, e.g., uw.edu, and see if you get different results. Report : What addresses did the dig command return? Copy dig results to your report (code block or screenshot). What did you observe when you browsed to the IP addresses directly? Aside from A records containing IP addresses, did you discover any other DNS records from your query? List at least 3 other record types that DNS manages (use Google to look up other kinds of records if your query returned less than 3 types!) Look closely at the output of the dig command. How can you be sure that the query completed successfully? Identify the IP address of the server used to handle your query. If you used PowerShell's Resolve-DnsName then you won't see the server IP that answered your request. Instead use ipconfig /all and find the IP under DNS Servers under your network interface. Part III - dev tools \u00b6 Open up a new tab preferably in a chromium based browser (Chrome, Brave, etc...). Open up the dev tools (right click on page and click Inspect), and go to the Network option. In that very same tab paste in your selected web page into the URL bar and click enter. You should see all of the GET and POST requests that the browser made for that webpage load up in the dev tools. Right-click the header of the Network Log table and select Domain. The domain of each resource is now shown. Take some time to scroll through the domains, files, and file types your website was requesting. Report : From a quick glance what is the most common file type requested? Approximately how many domains do you see in that list that don't matchup with the website domain you initially visited? Why do you think this page is getting information from other websites? If you had to guess, how many DNS requests do you think were sent in order to fully load this page? Part IV - wireshark \u00b6 Before examining DNS requests in Wireshark you will want to clear your DNS cache. Instructions on what that means, what it's for, and how to do so can be found here . Create a capture of you visiting your website by: Open Wireshark, begin a capture Quickly open a new tab and visit your website in your browser Once it has fully loaded end your Wireshark capture. Now filter for DNS packets only in the display filter. Identify the DNS response containing the information you needed in order to convert your website name into an IP address. Use the information contained within that packet for the following deliverable. Hint Learn how to use the search tool to find string content or research display filters that allow you to specify the domain name. Report : Assuming almost all of the DNS requests you see in Wireshark right now are for the one website you visited, how many DNS requests do you see? Overall were there less or more DNS queries than you'd expect? How did you identify the DNS packet(s) associated with the website you visited? Provide screenshots of the packet(s) (specifically of the DNS information in Packet Details). List the ip addresses you received for the website from the DNS server that resolved your request. Which transport layer protocol (think OSI model) is used to carry the DNS packet? Compare this DNS response to others in the capture (generate more if needed). Which port number(s) are shared in common across these DNS requests? Part V - security \u00b6 Open two packets in bytes view, a dns and a http packet that is encrypted with tls. Double click one of the DNS packets in order to be able to see the bytes view. Remove the dns display filter and replace it with tls (web traffic). Open one of the tls packets in byte view too. Report : Examine the bytes view of the two packets. Do you see any human readable values in the output? Looking at these two packets and others in your capture, does Wireshark provide any clues about whether or not your DNS is encrypted?

We\u2019re also going to look at how these addresses fit in to a group of protocols called the zero-configuration networking (zeroconf) protocols and explore how zeroconf appears in this class and in our daily use of network technology. This lab will require a combination of Wireshark analysis and Internet research. We\u2019ve provided links to several references as a starting point, but you are free to look up other resources as needed. Please cite all sources in your deliverable.

Part I - Identification \u00b6 Report: Before you start, take a moment to record some details about your computer and your Ethernet network adapter. These details may be helpful to you in your analysis: Hostname (Computer, Pi) MAC Address (Computer, Pi) Part II - Powering on your Pi \u00b6 If you already started your Pi, shut it down and disconnect power before you begin. Launch a new Wireshark capture over the Ethernet connection to your Pi. Linux users should listen on the \u201cAll\u201d interface and may want to disable their wireless connection before capturing to reduce noise and focus on the important details. With your capture running, power on the Pi. You\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the capture in order to see what happens when your computer and your Pi first connect to the network. Report: Identify the link-local addresses and mDNS names associated with your computer and your Pi. Using your capture as a reference, identify the messages that your Pi sends while autoconfiguring its own IP addresses. Describe the autoconfiguration process used by hosts to choose a link-local address and confirm that it is unique on the local network segment. Part III - Contacting your Pi \u00b6 With your capture still running, let\u2019s try to contact your Pi. Try pinging your Pi based on the hostname \u201craspberrypi.local\u201d (substitute your own hostname if you\u2019ve already changed it). Likewise, try connecting to your pi via SSH. Report: Using your capture, identify an example of an IPv4 and IPv6 mDNS request. Identify the multicast addresses used by mDNS in IPv4 and IPv6. Using your capture, identify an example of an IPv4 and IPv6 mDNS response. Are mDNS responses sent to a multicast address or to a specific unicast address. Identify the destination addresses used to reach your Pi in the final ICMP echo request (ping) and SSH connection. Part IV - Manually Querying mDNS devices \u00b6 Lastly, let\u2019s look at some tools that will allow us to manually query mDNS devices on our network. Unlike DNS, we should see that individual devices answer their own queries. Windows users can use the powershell command Resolve-DNSName while macOS and Linux users should be able to use dns-sd . Report: Search online or use man to look up syntax for the relevant command on your system, and make an mDNS request to your Pi. Provide a screenshot of your mDNS request and the output received. Part V - Protocol Research \u00b6 Perform your own research into these protocols and answer the following questions. We recommend starting with the resources listed at the end of this guide. In your own words, define the term multicast and describe how it differs from broadcast and unicast communication. Describe the major difference between how link local addresses are assigned and used in IPv4 versus in IPv6. In your own words, summarize what RFC 3927 says about determining whether two hosts are on the same link.

By the end of the lab you will be familiar with: ncat TCP handshakes http https Security faults of http We highly recommend using search engines to help you find solutions. Setup \u00b6 For this lab, we are going to use the incredibly versatile ncat utility to directly read and write data to and from HTTP(s) servers. Some of you may already be familiar with a similar tool known as netcat ( nc from the command line on most Linux or macOS machines). ncat is a re-implementation of netcat that adds some handy features (like SSL/TLS connections). Windows \u00b6 Please follow instructions to install ncat from https://nmap.org/ncat/ . You can accomplish this either by installing the nmap port scanner suite or by installing the portable executable . Please test your installation by running ncat from a new Powershell console. Note You may need to update your system path to include the directory in which you installed ncat . macOS and Linux \u00b6 Install nmap from your preferred package manager (e.g., apt or brew ) or follow instructions provided at nmap.org . Part I - TCP Analysis Introduction \u00b6 Capture \u00b6 The instructions below can be used to manually perform an HTTP exchange with a server via the ncat tool. This process approximates the exchange that occurs between your web browser and a web server after you enter a URL into the address bar or click on a hyperlink. Why don't I see any output? At this point, we're interacting directly with a server in a text-based protocol. The server will wait silently for you to enter a valid message. Per RFC 2616, the request you are sending is multiple lines and is terminated by two new lines . If you wait too long or submit something that violates the specification, the server will respond with an error and close the connection. Capture Instructions \u00b6 Create a capture filter that will select traffic from TCP ports 80 or 443. Launch a new Wireshark capture on your primary network interface with the capture filter from Step 1. Launch a couple of new terminals (mac/linux) or Powershell consoles (windows) and follow these steps to make HTTP requests to neverssl.com and wikipedia.org (in separate consoles): NeverSSL a. Open a new connection: ncat neverssl.com 80 b. Start a new HTTP requests (terminated with a newline ) GET / HTTP/1.1 c. Add a Host header followed by two new lines Host: neverssl.com Wikipedia a. Open a new connection: ncat --ssl www.wikipedia.org 443 b. Start a new HTTP requests (terminated with a newline ) GET / HTTP/1.1 c.

The work you do in this lab will be extremely helpful in becoming more comfortable with your Raspberry Pi. We will walk you through all of the required steps in lab, but all the required steps are also in this webpage. Before you start \u00b6 Everyone \u00b6 Confirm that you have created a DigitalOcean account, and that on the top right of the website it says you have $100.00 of credits. This will allow you to create virtual machine \u201cDroplets\u201d on DigitalOcean without incurring any direct cost. In addition to the email we sent on Sunday, instructions to complete this task can be found in here . Windows \u00b6 Determine which build of Windows 10 they have installed by running Get-ComputerInfo -Property WindowsVersion in PowerShell. The minimum version of Windows 10 required for this course is 1809, but you may proceed with this lab as long as you are running 1803. For any prior version of Windows (older than 1803), please install Git for Windows from https://gitforwindows.org/ and use the Git Bash environment to complete the following set of exercises instead of PowerShell. Create SSH client keys \u00b6 To use the DigitalOcean server we will soon create, you'll need a way to authenticate yourself and login to your server. While you might think a password will suffice, we will be using a more secure method of authentication through SSH keys. SSH stands for 'Secure Shell'. A 'shell' is a command line interface, such as the one's you've seen in Terminal, PowerShell, or Git Bash. Throughout this course, you'll be using the shell, remotely, to configure Linux. SSH makes the shell 'secure' by create a pair of keys that you use to authenticate yourself to a remote shell. These 'keys' are simply long strings of characters that are tied together with some complex mathematics. We will use a program called ssh-keygen to create this pair of keys. ssh-keygen will generate a private key, and a public key. Your public key can be given out, to say, DigitalOcean, while your private key remains only on your computer. In short, SSH works as follows in our scenario: Your computer connects to the DigitalOcean-hosted server via a remote shell The DigitalOcean-hosted server encrypts a file with your public key (sort of like creating a hash for it) and sends the encrypted file to you. Only your private key will be able to decrypt the file (sort of like getting back the original data that wash hashed). Your computer uses your private key to decrypt the file, then sends back the decrypted file to the server. You have now proved that you have the private key that matched the public key. To create your SSH keypair, use ssh-keygen as follows: With either Terminal (for Mac) or PowerShell/Git Bash (for Windows) run the following command with your own email address: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <YOUR@EMAIL> You will be prompted for a file name for the private SSH key. Accept the default by pressing the Enter key. You will be prompted for a passphrase. This is important as it is used to protect your private SSH key. Make it something strong, like you would a password, and commit it to memory or write it down somewhere. If you are prompted to overwrite anything, type n and press the Enter key (OPTIONAL STEP) To avoid having to enter the passphrase every time you use your private key, set up ssh-agent as describe in this tutorial . Create a Debian 9 Server on DigitalOcean \u00b6 Log into your DigitalOcean account, go to the 'Droplet' tab on the left, and click 'Create Droplet'. Then set the Droplet up based on the following parameters: Image Debian 9.12 x64 Plan Starter / $5 per month Authentication SSH keys Right under the 'SSH keys' option in the 'Authentication' section, you'll see a button that says 'New SSH Key'. Press it, and you'll be prompted for your public SSH key. To get your public SSH key, enter the following in either Terminal (for Mac) or PowerShell/Git Bash (for Windows) cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub Warning Make sure to enter the .pub extension at the end of this line! Without the extension, you will get back your private key instead of your public key! You should then see a string like this: Copy the string (from the ssh-ed25519 all the way to the end of your email) and paste it into the 'Add public SSH key' window in DigitalOcean like so: Then type a name for the key (something like 'My Macbook Pro') and press 'Add SSH Key' Now you are all set to create the Droplet. Scroll down to and press 'Create Droplet'. If you want, you can create a name for this server in the 'Choose a hostname' section. Wait for the droplet to be created. When it's finished, copy the IP address of the server for the next section. It's the number right next to the server's name. Connect and Manage your Server \u00b6 Log in to the droplet as the root user via SSH \u00b6 In order to manage our remote server, we\u2019ll use SSH to connect remotely. Since we have already associated a set of SSH keys with the server, we will be able to log in the the server as the 'root' user without directly entering a password. The 'root' user is the default user on a Linux system, and it has permission to do anything . This is much different from a standard user account, say 'John', who only has permission to write, read, or execute certain files, like his user directory. We will begin this lab by logging in as the 'root' user, but we will soon create another user on the server and use that instead. It's typically not advised to use the root user on a Linux system unless what you're doing requires it. The syntax for ssh is: ssh <USERNAME>@<SERVER> We'll log in as the 'root' user, and use the IP address we copied earlier: e.g., ssh root@<SERVER_IP> for me that's ssh root@104.248.59.220 If you entered the command correctly, you should see something like: The authenticity of host '104.248.59.220 (104.248.59.220)' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:... Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? This is your computer letting you know it's never connected to this server before. That's okay, so: Type yes and press enter. You will then be prompted with something like: Warning: Permanently added '104.248.59.220' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts. Linux debian-info314-sp20 4.9.0-12-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.210-1 (2020-01-20) x86_64 The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software; the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright. Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by applicable law. And finally you see something like this: root@debian-fdk542-432kgs:~# To receive credit for this lab, you need to create a transcript of all the commands you issue to the server. To do this, we will use the script command to capture your session. Enter: script root-session This will use the script program to create a log of all your shell input and save it to a file named root-session You should see this message: Script started, file is root-session Now, everything you type in this shell will now be captured in a file named root-session within your home directory. If you need to exit the server anytime, just type exit . The first time you exit you'll get the output: Script done, file is root-session This lets you know that script has finished recording and have saved the transcript. Next, type exit once more and you will be logged out of the SSH session, receving the message: logout Connection to 104.248.59.220 closed. Warning It's important that if you exit from the server and then reconnect to it (via ssh ) that you continue your script. This will ensure everything keeps being recorded and you will get full credit for the lab. To continue the script, type: script -a root-session after you SSH back into the server. You'll again be prompted with: Script started, file is root-session which ensures that your next commands will be appended to the root-session file Create a second user account \u00b6 In most situations, we will not work directly as the root user, since this would pose additional security risks. In fact, many Linux distributions will prevent direct root login. Let\u2019s create a new user and practice working with this configuration. Add a new user by entering this (where is your name or something else you'll remember) adduser <YOUR_USERNAME> you'll be prompted for other information, such as a password and a name. Give the account a password you'll remember, and skip the other fields (such as name) by pressing 'Enter'. Then, add the user to the sudo group: usermod -aG sudo <YOUR_USERNAME> This allows the new user to use sudo before commands. Using sudo allows a user who is not root to use root privaleges on a per-command basis. By default, DigitalOcean prevents users from connecting via SSH without an SSH key. This is the correct decision from the security perspective, but we will disable it temporarily in order to explore beneath the hood. Modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config to enable password-based login by editing it as follows: First, open sshd_config in nano by using: nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config This will open nano . nano is a terminal-based editor, and is very simple. You can only move the cursor by using the arrow keys. To copy text from a file using nano , select it using your mouse and then copy it as usual (Control+C on Windows, Command + C on Mac) In nano , Find the: PasswordAuthentication no setting and prefix it with a # comment character, so it should read: #PasswordAuthentication no Then save the document in nano by pressing: Control + X in Windows, Command + X in Mac. Settings don\u2019t take effect automatically. Use the systemctl tool to restart the sshd service: systemctl restart sshd Log in as your new user \u00b6 In a new terminal window , log in as the new user via SSH using the password you created above. Capture a script of your session by calling: script user-session The results of this command will be saved in a file named user-session. When you log in, run: pwd and make note of the directory. This is your home directory. Notice that the home directory for each user is different. Try listing the contents of the root user\u2019s home directory by typing: ls -al /root You should receive a permission denied error. The /root path is owned by the root user and has permissions restricted so that other users cannot read, write, or execute the directory or anything else it contains. Since root is a special user, the restriction does not apply in the other direction. Demonstrate this difference in permissions by listing the contents of the new user\u2019s home directory from the root user\u2019s shell , e.g., ls -al /home/clinton from your root login and view the contents of my user\u2019s home directory. By default in basic Linux distributions, the root user has complete control over all system and user resources and is even able to take on the identity of other users without knowing their passwords. Running Administrative Commands \u00b6 Many of the administration tasks we need to complete throughout the quarter require root level permissions. Since we\u2019ve already established that we will deliberately work as a non-root user, we should determine a method to elevate our privileges. In Linux and other Unix-based operating systems, the command that allows us to do this is called sudo . By prefixing any valid shell command or program name with sudo , we will assume the identity of root at runtime. Test this out by comparing the results of ( within the new user's shell ) whoami with the results of sudo whoami The next step will require us to log out of our current ssh session. Before you do this, type exit to end the current script session. You should see a message stating that the script is complete. You may now log out of ssh by running the exit command. Add SSH keys for your user \u00b6 As you\u2019ve seen, we can log into the root account without entering a password because of the SSH keys that we created at the beginning of this lab, but logging into our new user account requires a password (which is a much weaker configuration from a security perspective). Let\u2019s resolve this by adding our public SSH key to the new user account on our Droplet. First switch back to your root shell and examine the files saved in the .ssh folder of root\u2019s home directory. To do this, we'll switch to the .ssh directory using cd . cd stands for 'Change Directory' and will let you switch the folder you are in. To change to the .ssh folder type: cd .ssh Now you can use ls -al to view the contents of the folder once you are in it. What you should see in the specified path is a file named authorized_keys that contains a copy of your SSH public key on a line by itself. We\u2019ll be creating a similar file in the home directory of our new user. On each login attempt, the SSH server checks for authorized_keys designated for the user and loads. First, within a new terminal window , type: ssh <YOUR_USERNAME>@<SERVER_IP> 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh' This creates a quick SSH session into your user, and makes a new directory called .ssh for that user. Next, you'll copy your public key ( $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ) to the Droplet using the scp command. scp is part of the OpenSSH client package and is used to copy files between paths on local and remote hosts. You will notice that it uses ssh syntax to identify the remote location followed by a colon and the actual source or target path at the remote location: NOTE: The following command is entered as one line but is wrapped due to the constraints of the editor. scp $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <YOUR_USERNAME>@<SERVER_IP>:.ssh/authorized_keys Be aware that scp respects file permissions. When connecting as my non-root user, I cannot read or write to locations that are restricted to other users or root. Install a web server \u00b6 Test that you successfully copied your public key to the server and can access the Droplet as your non-root user without having to enter a server password: ssh <YOUR_USERNAME>@<SERVER_IP> You should not be prompted for your UNIX/Linux user password you set, it should instead use the SSH key as before, and if you set it, ask for the SSH passphrase. Once you are logged back in, resume your script by running script -a user-session Install the nginx web service using the command: sudo apt install nginx Verify that the service installed correctly by running systemctl status nginx and confirming that the nginx service is loaded and running. Use a web browser to navigate to your IP address and load the default nginx site, e.g., > , in my case http://134.209.4.234 Once you have completed these tasks, please close out the scripts from your root and user shell by typing exit twice on each shell. Now on your computer (no longer on the server!) , use scp to copy the scripts over by typing: scp root@<SERVER_IP>:root-session $HOME/Desktop and scp <YOUR_USERNAME>@<SERVER_IP>:user-session $HOME/Desktop They will be on your desktop.

While you might think a password will suffice, we will be using a more secure method of authentication through SSH keys. SSH stands for 'Secure Shell'. A 'shell' is a command line interface, such as the one's you've seen in Terminal, PowerShell, or Git Bash. Throughout this course, you'll be using the shell, remotely, to configure Linux. SSH makes the shell 'secure' by create a pair of keys that you use to authenticate yourself to a remote shell. These 'keys' are simply long strings of characters that are tied together with some complex mathematics. We will use a program called ssh-keygen to create this pair of keys. ssh-keygen will generate a private key, and a public key. Your public key can be given out, to say, DigitalOcean, while your private key remains only on your computer. In short, SSH works as follows in our scenario: Your computer connects to the DigitalOcean-hosted server via a remote shell The DigitalOcean-hosted server encrypts a file with your public key (sort of like creating a hash for it) and sends the encrypted file to you. Only your private key will be able to decrypt the file (sort of like getting back the original data that wash hashed). Your computer uses your private key to decrypt the file, then sends back the decrypted file to the server. You have now proved that you have the private key that matched the public key. To create your SSH keypair, use ssh-keygen as follows: With either Terminal (for Mac) or PowerShell/Git Bash (for Windows) run the following command with your own email address: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <YOUR@EMAIL> You will be prompted for a file name for the private SSH key. Accept the default by pressing the Enter key. You will be prompted for a passphrase. This is important as it is used to protect your private SSH key. Make it something strong, like you would a password, and commit it to memory or write it down somewhere. If you are prompted to overwrite anything, type n and press the Enter key (OPTIONAL STEP) To avoid having to enter the passphrase every time you use your private key, set up ssh-agent as describe in this tutorial .","title":"Create SSH client keys"},{"location":"labs/misc/lab1/#create-a-debian-9-server-on-digitalocean","text":"Log into your DigitalOcean account, go to the 'Droplet' tab on the left, and click 'Create Droplet'.

Press it, and you'll be prompted for your public SSH key. To get your public SSH key, enter the following in either Terminal (for Mac) or PowerShell/Git Bash (for Windows) cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub Warning Make sure to enter the .pub extension at the end of this line! Without the extension, you will get back your private key instead of your public key! You should then see a string like this: Copy the string (from the ssh-ed25519 all the way to the end of your email) and paste it into the 'Add public SSH key' window in DigitalOcean like so: Then type a name for the key (something like 'My Macbook Pro') and press 'Add SSH Key' Now you are all set to create the Droplet.

Since we have already associated a set of SSH keys with the server, we will be able to log in the the server as the 'root' user without directly entering a password. The 'root' user is the default user on a Linux system, and it has permission to do anything . This is much different from a standard user account, say 'John', who only has permission to write, read, or execute certain files, like his user directory. We will begin this lab by logging in as the 'root' user, but we will soon create another user on the server and use that instead. It's typically not advised to use the root user on a Linux system unless what you're doing requires it. The syntax for ssh is: ssh <USERNAME>@<SERVER> We'll log in as the 'root' user, and use the IP address we copied earlier: e.g., ssh root@<SERVER_IP> for me that's ssh root@104.248.59.220 If you entered the command correctly, you should see something like: The authenticity of host '104.248.59.220 (104.248.59.220)' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:... Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? This is your computer letting you know it's never connected to this server before.

And finally you see something like this: root@debian-fdk542-432kgs:~# To receive credit for this lab, you need to create a transcript of all the commands you issue to the server. To do this, we will use the script command to capture your session. Enter: script root-session This will use the script program to create a log of all your shell input and save it to a file named root-session You should see this message: Script started, file is root-session Now, everything you type in this shell will now be captured in a file named root-session within your home directory. If you need to exit the server anytime, just type exit . The first time you exit you'll get the output: Script done, file is root-session This lets you know that script has finished recording and have saved the transcript. Next, type exit once more and you will be logged out of the SSH session, receving the message: logout Connection to 104.248.59.220 closed. Warning It's important that if you exit from the server and then reconnect to it (via ssh ) that you continue your script. This will ensure everything keeps being recorded and you will get full credit for the lab. To continue the script, type: script -a root-session after you SSH back into the server.

In fact, many Linux distributions will prevent direct root login. Let\u2019s create a new user and practice working with this configuration. Add a new user by entering this (where is your name or something else you'll remember) adduser <YOUR_USERNAME> you'll be prompted for other information, such as a password and a name. Give the account a password you'll remember, and skip the other fields (such as name) by pressing 'Enter'. Then, add the user to the sudo group: usermod -aG sudo <YOUR_USERNAME> This allows the new user to use sudo before commands. Using sudo allows a user who is not root to use root privaleges on a per-command basis. By default, DigitalOcean prevents users from connecting via SSH without an SSH key. This is the correct decision from the security perspective, but we will disable it temporarily in order to explore beneath the hood. Modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config to enable password-based login by editing it as follows: First, open sshd_config in nano by using: nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config This will open nano . nano is a terminal-based editor, and is very simple. You can only move the cursor by using the arrow keys. To copy text from a file using nano , select it using your mouse and then copy it as usual (Control+C on Windows, Command + C on Mac) In nano , Find the: PasswordAuthentication no setting and prefix it with a # comment character, so it should read: #PasswordAuthentication no Then save the document in nano by pressing: Control + X in Windows, Command + X in Mac.

This is your home directory. Notice that the home directory for each user is different. Try listing the contents of the root user\u2019s home directory by typing: ls -al /root You should receive a permission denied error. The /root path is owned by the root user and has permissions restricted so that other users cannot read, write, or execute the directory or anything else it contains. Since root is a special user, the restriction does not apply in the other direction. Demonstrate this difference in permissions by listing the contents of the new user\u2019s home directory from the root user\u2019s shell , e.g., ls -al /home/clinton from your root login and view the contents of my user\u2019s home directory.

By prefixing any valid shell command or program name with sudo , we will assume the identity of root at runtime. Test this out by comparing the results of ( within the new user's shell ) whoami with the results of sudo whoami The next step will require us to log out of our current ssh session.

Let\u2019s resolve this by adding our public SSH key to the new user account on our Droplet. First switch back to your root shell and examine the files saved in the .ssh folder of root\u2019s home directory. To do this, we'll switch to the .ssh directory using cd . cd stands for 'Change Directory' and will let you switch the folder you are in. To change to the .ssh folder type: cd .ssh Now you can use ls -al to view the contents of the folder once you are in it. What you should see in the specified path is a file named authorized_keys that contains a copy of your SSH public key on a line by itself. We\u2019ll be creating a similar file in the home directory of our new user. On each login attempt, the SSH server checks for authorized_keys designated for the user and loads. First, within a new terminal window , type: ssh <YOUR_USERNAME>@<SERVER_IP> 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh' This creates a quick SSH session into your user, and makes a new directory called .ssh for that user. Next, you'll copy your public key ( $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ) to the Droplet using the scp command. scp is part of the OpenSSH client package and is used to copy files between paths on local and remote hosts. You will notice that it uses ssh syntax to identify the remote location followed by a colon and the actual source or target path at the remote location: NOTE: The following command is entered as one line but is wrapped due to the constraints of the editor. scp $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <YOUR_USERNAME>@<SERVER_IP>:.ssh/authorized_keys Be aware that scp respects file permissions.

All code development for this task should take place in http-proxy.py . HTTP proxies incorporate server and client functionality into a single daemon. As a server, your proxy listens and process the requests it receives from browsers and other HTTP clients. As a client, your proxy will pass the clients' requests on to the intended destination and handle the responses in return. We can implement this behavior by creating both types of sockets within the same application and passing the relevant information between them. In this task, we will work exclusively on the server functionality of the proxy. Specifically, we'll build a server that processes the incoming TCP stream and parses out HTTP GET requests. In future assignments, we'll extend our code to handle other message types and implement the client functionality. Main Loop (Event Loop) \u00b6 To start out this lab, it will be helpful to reference the server logic you created in the main function of your echo server. On the server side, our proxy will build on connection and communication flow we established in that task. Namely, we want to provide a way for a web browser to repeatedly open new connections in order to send HTTP requests and receive the corresponding response (one request/response per connection). Within the echo server, you wrote a loop that would receive the next connection from accept() and begin to process it. This loop is the basis for handling the connections that will be made from web browsers that are configured to speak through the proxy. You should be aware, however, that the connection handling process for a proxy is more complex than what we created for the echo server. To provide a minimally functional echo server, we could get away with making a single call to Socket.recv() per connection. This would accept the first chunk of data received and enable us to echo it back from the client. There are limitations on this approach since it doesn't take advantage of the stream -based nature of a TCP connection (or even fully recognize its constraints). The benefit to us, however, is that we didn't have to think to critically about how to recognize the end of an echo request . Stream-Oriented Protocols and the Sockets API \u00b6 As you move forward in the next few labs, you will need to wrestle with what it means to work with a stream-oriented protocol and the way in which that is implemented within the Sockets API. The main implication of the stream metaphor is that we don't have an easy way to recognize where messages (like HTTP requests and responses) start and end. The only thing we can take for granted when we call Socket.recv() , is that we received a new chunk of data from the stream. Depending on the behavior of the TCP client and server, the chunk of data could represent an entire message (as we assumed for our echo), part of a message, or even multiple messages. Likewise, we need to be aware that a call to Socket.recv() when we have already received everything from the other side will hang until a timeout occurs and the connection is closed. Further discussion of this can be found in the latter sections of the Real Python tutorial In order to read from a stream, you will need to wrap Socket.recv() within an infinite loop, breaking out only when you can determine that you've received a complete message -or- when you detect that the connection is closed from the other side. In order to know where messages begin and end, we have to inspect the incoming bytes based on HTTP message syntax, which will be the primary goal of this lab. This is worth repeating one more time: Important Don't assume that recv() will return a complete HTTP message in one call. The Sockets API does not even guarantee that it will return the full number of bytes you requested, i.e., Socket.recv(1024) returns up to 1024 bytes of data from the stream. Store Incomplete Messages in a Buffer \u00b6 Since it is up to you to identify and reconstruct messages out of the stream, you should create a buffer that will hold your data while you work to identify complete HTTP messages. A buffer in this case is nothing more than a python bytes object that you append to each time a recv() returns successfully, for example: # Declare an empty buffer buffer = b '' while True : data = conn . recv ( 1024 ) # break if the connection was closed if not data : break # add new data to the buffer. buffer = buffer + data Working HTTP Messages \u00b6 In order to recognize HTTP messages, we will attempt to parse our buffer each time we add new data in order to test whether we can read the message through to its proper end. When this operation succeeds, we will be able to move forward into the client portion of the proxy that we'll explore in upcoming labs. While this operation fails, we will continue to receive new data and add it to our buffer as discussed in the previous section. Your main task for this lab is to build a simple HTTP parser that accepts a byte buffer and attempts to parse the most basic type of HTTP message, i.e., an HTTP/1.0 GET request (ignore other types of requests for now). In order to parse a GET request, you will read through the message a line at a time until you receive back-to-back CRLF (HTTP end-of-line) sequences indicating that you've reached the end of the HTTP headers. This task may require a small amount of research into RFC-1945 to review the HTTP/1.0 specification, but it builds directly off of the string and byte manipulation operations you practiced in the previous lab. From a code standpoint, please encapsulate your parsing logic in a function called parse_message . This message should accept a buffer of bytes as input and return two values, i.e., a parsed message stored in a python dictionary and a byte buffer containing data that was left after parsing the message (which could be part of another request). If you are not able to parse the message completely, you can indicate this by returning None and the original byte buffer. Based on this description, your parsing function should resemble: def parse_message ( data ) # initialize an empty dictionary message = {} # parse bytes and assign key / value pairs such as ... message [ 'method' ] = # HTTP method name such as GET message [ 'uri' ] = # address or resource name from the request, such as www.uw.edu message [ 'version' ] = # HTTP version such as HTTP/1.0 message [ 'headers' ] = [] # List of headers # If parsing is successful, return a completed message (if applicable) and unused bytes return message , unparsed_data # If parsing fails, return the entire buffer and an indicator that parsing was incomplete return None , data Parsing \u00b6 HTTP messages follow a relatively simple syntax that can be used to make decisions about how to break the message into smaller parts (using tools like Python slicing and the functions find() , strip() , and split() ). Assume that all messages are conformant with HTTP/1.0 and encoded as ISO-8859-1. For GET requests, the message structure is based entirely around lines and the Carriage Return / New Line line separators (think back to previous labs in which we sent GET requests using netcat). It's tempting for many students to read this and start parsing with a data.split('\\r\\n') . This strategy rarely works. Instead, we recommend that you create a dedicated function to split a single line off the buffer. You can do this with find() , strip() , and slices . Before you go any further, make sure you have a basic understanding of HTTP/1.0 message structure. RFC-1945 is the ultimate authority for message structure, but I recommend checking out the other resources as well for a concise overview of the request/response format. RFC-1945 How HTTP Works under the Hood HTTP syntax overview Output \u00b6 After successfully parsing a request, you should print the following summary and close the connection (return to the start of your loop to listen for new requests).

All code development for this task should take place in http-proxy.py . In the previous lab, we started to build the server component of your proxy. This component is designed to receive incoming requests from web clients and then eventually forward responses that were received from an upstream web server. The core of the server is established on a request parser, which we also started to develop in the last assignment. In this lab, we'll extend our proxy to recognize more complex HTTP requests and build the logic to forward these requests to the intended target. This will require us to: a) create a new function that can rebuild an HTTP request in byte form based on the dictionary representation generated by your parsing code and b) open a new client socket to a dynamic location each time we receive a request. Parsing Requests (cont.) \u00b6 Extend your parsing function built in the previous lab to handle more complex HTTP requests, such as the POST or PUT type. You'll recall that the GET request structure allows a variable number of CRLF terminated header lines followed by an empty CRLF line. The full HTTP specification allows for an additional message body following the HTTP headers, however there are some important points you need to observe as you handle this part of the HTTP request: While the header portion of the message is ISO-8859-1 encoded per specification, the body/payload should be treated as raw, binary data (even when it looks like standard text-based HTML). Always handle this portion of the request in Python byte form. DO NOT DECODE THE PAYLOAD TO STRING. This will have side effects that can make it impossible to recognize the end of the message. Unlike the header portion of the message, line-endings occuring in the data/payload portion of the HTTP request are coincidental. They do not imply anything about the structure of the message from an HTTP point-of-view. DO NOT SPLIT/STRIP NEWLINES IN THE PAYLOAD. As before, any changes you make to this portion of the message will impact your ability to recognize the message boundary. The structure of a POST, PUT, and other HTTP requests expands on the GET request, allowing a chunk of raw data to be appended after the CRLF that signals the end of the HTTP headers. Unlike the lines that came before, this data is raw, i.e., unstructured, and it will require a different approach based on the expected length of the data. As such, we need to find out the length of the body component before we can determine whether it's been received completely. In HTTP 1.0, the body length is defined by an HTTP header called Content-Length . 1 The value of Content-Length will be a numeric string that defines the length of the body payload. If you see this field while you are parsing your headers, you should record it's value within a variable and add it to your message dictionary, e.g., if header [ 'name' ] == 'Content-Length' : message [ 'Content-Length' ] = int ( header [ 'value' ]) Taking into account that a message may contain a payload, we need to make sure that parse_message waits for the complete payload before returning a valid message back to the main recv() loop. You will need to check for several possible edge cases in order to handle this correctly. If content-length is defined and greater than zero, you need to look at the unparsed portion of the buffer for the message body. If the unparsed portion of the buffer is shorter (see len() ) than content-length, you should return to the recv() loop and wait for the remaining data. If the unparsed portion of the buffer is longer than content-length, the extra bytes should remain in the buffer. If you succeed in parsing a complete message, save the bytes into the message dictionary that contains the other fields you've parsed. Remove all of the correctly parsed bytes from the buffer and return to your main function. As in the previous lab, you should leave the buffer untouched if parsing fails. Return control to your connection handling loop in main and continue to wait for the rest of the message. Get Destination URL \u00b6 Our HTTP/1.0 proxy will expect exactly one HTTP request to be delivered per connection. After our parsing logic determines that we have received a complete/valid message, we can break out of our receiving loop and continue processing the request. Our next step in processing a request is to determine where the browser intended to send the message. We'll use this information in order to open a client socket to the destination server. The information we need to locate the destination is contained in the URI of the request. If you followed the sample code from the previous lab, this value should have been saved as the 'uri' element of the message dictionary. Parsing this field with the Python urllib library will provide us with a host name/address and port that you can use to establish a client socket with the target (see echo-client.py for syntax to open a client socket). Since Python provides a URL parsing module, this is theoretically an easy task. However, it turns out that real browsers produce a variety of edge cases that will cause urllib to choke. In order to constrain the difficulty of this lab, we are providing you with the following function to complete this section. # Be sure to add the import to the top of your code from urllib.parse import urlparse # returns the host and port # run by doing: h, p = parse_uri(dest) def parse_uri ( uri ): uri_parts = urlparse ( uri ) scheme = uri_parts . scheme host = uri_parts . hostname # urlparse can't deal with partial URI's that don't include the # protocol, e.g., push.services.mozilla.com:443 if host : # correctly parsed if uri_parts . port : port = uri_parts . port else : port = socket . getservbyname ( scheme ) else : # incorrectly parsed uri_parts = uri . split ( ':' ) host = uri_parts [ 0 ] if len ( uri ) > 1 : port = int ( uri_parts [ 1 ]) else : port = 80 return host , port Build Message \u00b6 At this point, we have a request, and we know it's destination. The last objective for this week is to create a new function that takes a decomposed message (the dictionary returned from your parser) and generates a new message in byte form. This function is the inverse of the parsing logic you wrote in the last two labs (with one modification for now). 2 The easiest way to rebuild a message from it's parts is to use Python3 format strings, as shown in the example below. At this point, we would like you to make one change to the original request. Regardless of which HTTP version is defined, rebuild the message as an HTTP/1.0 request. def build_message ( message ): # Please note that we are replacing the original version (this is intentional) message_header = ' {} {} {} \\r\\n ' . format ( message [ 'method' ], message [ 'uri' ], 'HTTP/1.0' ) for header in message [ 'headers' ]: data = data + ' {} \\r\\n ' . format ( 'TODO' ) # Format each header properly # Don't forget to add a terminating CRLF # Encode the header portion of the message as bytes # Do you have a message body? Add it back now Client Socket \u00b6 We'll conclude this sequence of tasks by establishing our outbound client socket and sending the request to it's destination. The most important point to remember at this point is how the end-to-end connection flow works. Your main code block should contain a loop to accept connections from browsers. Each connection that you accept will be used to service one outbound request and a corresponding inbound response. The request is received over the server socket you've already established. You used a second loop to call Socket.recv() until you could parse a valid request. Using the parse_uri(request['uri']) function from above, determine the host and port for the outbound client socket. Follow the pattern established in the echo_client to open the connection to this destination. Use build_message(request) to convert the parsed request back into byte form and send it with the Socket.sendall(data) function demonstrated in the echo_client and RealPython guides. Finally, attempt one call to Socket.recv() to try and receive the first part of the response. If you have been successful in receiving and rebuilding the request, you should receive a response immediately from the server. Errors in the preceeding step may result in your proxy hanging (while waiting for a response) or the server resetting the connection due to bad data. We have two more weeks to debug your code. If it breaks here, comment out the final recv() and print a summary of the request you've received as shown below. Output \u00b6 Once all parts of your code are working, print the following summary (replace the output from the previous lab) and close the connection. This will return to the start of your loop to listen for new connections. Request summary Connection Source: < IP address returned from the call to Socket.accept() > HTTP Method: < Name of method, e.g., GET, OPTION, or POST > Destination: < URI extracted from the request > Headers: < Comma delimited list of header names > Target: < Hostname of server obtained from request > Message: < Raw bytes of the rebuilt request > Reponse: < First 50 bytes of the response (if working) > What are these diamonds \"< >\" ? These are placeholders. When you see these it means you should fill in information that is between them and then delete the symbols. It's a quick way of saying \"hey something needs to be filled in\" for the developer world. Testing your code with test.py \u00b6 The resources directory of the project repository contains a simple python script called test.py that you can use to send HTTP requests from a file into your proxy code. # Send the request from sample-request.txt on port 9999 250 bytes at a time with a short delay between python3 test.py 9999 get_request.http 250 Note: Testing at this stage can be more challenging. Please ask for help via the course Slack if you need it. Capturing proxied requests for testing \u00b6 Use the following method to capture valid requests that you can use for testing: Open ncat to listen for incoming connections, e.g., ncat -o <FILENAME> -l <PORT> Configure Firefox with an HTTP proxy on 127.0.0.1 <PORT> Enter the URL of an HTTP-only site into the FF address bar (the request will hang) Manually stop the request from the browser Verify that the request was captured in ncat (ncat will close automatically) This is an oversimplification of the RFC for HTTP/1.0, but it will be sufficient for our purposes. \u21a9 I realize it seems strange to rebuild the message you just spent time tearing apart, but this approach gives you more leverage in terms of what functions your proxy can provide. For example, notice how easily we can modify the HTTP version and add new headers. \u21a9","title":"Lab 8 - proxy part II"},{"location":"labs/sockets/lab8/#lab-8-proxy-part-ii","text":"TODO Lab 8 Assignment page on Canvas","title":"Lab 8 - proxy part II"},{"location":"labs/sockets/lab8/#python-concepts","text":"Slicing lists / strings Converting strings to/from numbers Creating and using enumerations Format strings, e.g., \"{}: {}\\r\\n\".format(header_name, header_value)","title":"Python concepts"},{"location":"labs/sockets/lab8/#instructions","text":"","title":"Instructions"},{"location":"labs/sockets/lab8/#getting-started","text":"As always, create a new branch dedicated to this lab within your http-proxy repository.

If the unparsed portion of the buffer is shorter (see len() ) than content-length, you should return to the recv() loop and wait for the remaining data. If the unparsed portion of the buffer is longer than content-length, the extra bytes should remain in the buffer. If you succeed in parsing a complete message, save the bytes into the message dictionary that contains the other fields you've parsed. Remove all of the correctly parsed bytes from the buffer and return to your main function. As in the previous lab, you should leave the buffer untouched if parsing fails. Return control to your connection handling loop in main and continue to wait for the rest of the message.","title":"Parsing Requests (cont.)"},{"location":"labs/sockets/lab8/#get-destination-url","text":"Our HTTP/1.0 proxy will expect exactly one HTTP request to be delivered per connection. After our parsing logic determines that we have received a complete/valid message, we can break out of our receiving loop and continue processing the request. Our next step in processing a request is to determine where the browser intended to send the message. We'll use this information in order to open a client socket to the destination server. The information we need to locate the destination is contained in the URI of the request. If you followed the sample code from the previous lab, this value should have been saved as the 'uri' element of the message dictionary. Parsing this field with the Python urllib library will provide us with a host name/address and port that you can use to establish a client socket with the target (see echo-client.py for syntax to open a client socket). Since Python provides a URL parsing module, this is theoretically an easy task. However, it turns out that real browsers produce a variety of edge cases that will cause urllib to choke.

You used a second loop to call Socket.recv() until you could parse a valid request. Using the parse_uri(request['uri']) function from above, determine the host and port for the outbound client socket. Follow the pattern established in the echo_client to open the connection to this destination. Use build_message(request) to convert the parsed request back into byte form and send it with the Socket.sendall(data) function demonstrated in the echo_client and RealPython guides.

Instructions \u00b6 Getting Started \u00b6 As always, create a new branch dedicated to this lab within your http-proxy repository. All code development for this task should take place in http-proxy.py . In the last lab, we completed three major tasks: a) extended our parse_message function to handle different types of HTTP requests, b) created a function to build a message based on the dictionary structure created by the parser, and c) opened a new client socket based for each request received by the proxy. The main objectives of this lab will be to extend parsing functionality to handle HTTP responses as well as requests and to complete our end-to-end message flow. HTTP Version Please confirm that you have followed the instructions in previous labs to downgrade the HTTP version to HTTP/1.0. Newer versions of HTTP have more complicated connection management, where as HTTP/1.0 connections are used for just one request/response. Parsing Responses \u00b6 Structurally, there is almost no difference between an HTTP request with a message body and an HTTP response. In fact, the only difference from your parser's perspective is the order of fields in the first line of the message. 1 If we know the type of message we're parsing before we start, it's easy to extend your parse_message() function to handle HTTP requests and responses. For our needs, this is an easy requirement since the proxy will always know whether it's receiving a request vs. a response based on which socket is in use. To build this functionality for yourself, add a message_type argument to your parser function. Modify the behavior of the function to parse the first line properly based on this argument, and include the message_type in the parsed message. Once you're confident that this is working, update your build_message function to check the type field and produce the appropriate bytes. There are many ways to handle a field like message_type. The most obvious, though inefficient, approach is to simply pass a string value such as REQUEST or RESPONSE and to test for the value when it is used. From a software engineering perspective, we prefer (but don't require) you to use a data type that is built for this purpose, i.e., the enumeration. Enumerations are data types that map a fixed set of values to numeric constants, and they're useful for any type where we need to compare to a predefined list such as the type of socket or the bit flags of a TCP header. While they require a little more effort, enumerations provide advantages in terms of compile-time error detection and run-time efficiency (over string comparisons). The code below demonstrates how to create and use a MessageType enumeration within your code. # Required imports from enum import Enum , auto # Enumeration to represent message types class MessageType ( Enum ): REQUEST = auto () # constant values are auto-assigned RESPONSE = auto () # constant values are auto-assigned # Use the is operator rather than == to test an enumeration \u2026 def parse_message ( data , message_type ): ... message [ 'type' ] = message_type if message [ 'type' ] is MessageType . REQUEST : # parse request fields ... def main (): ... # parse an incoming request parse_message ( buffer , MessageType . REQUEST ) Connection Flow \u00b6 With your parse/build code working correctly, your proxy is almost complete. Turn you attention to completing the connection flow between a browser and the final destination of a request. A summary of this message flow for a single request/response appears below. Upon receipt of a valid request, parse the URI to determine the host and port for the destination server that's been requested by the client. Within your event handling loop, create a client socket to the destination associated with the new request. The host and port are provided by the previous step. Reconstruct the request using the build_message function from the previous lab and send it out over your new client socket. Set up a new loop to listen on this socket until you have received the HTTP response coming back from the web server. As with the original HTTP request, you'll need to keep trying until you can parse the complete request. The browser is still waiting for a response to its request. Reconstruct the response and send it back to the browser over the original server socket. Close the connection to the client and resume waiting for new connections. Testing \u00b6 You may wish to start out using the test.py function for testing purposes in this lab, though its capabilities are limited. In particular, test.py cannot properly send a response in \"line mode\" (you have to provide an integer argument to tell it to break the message into fixed size chunks). When you reach the point that your code returns a successful HTTP response to the test script, you should move on to testing with the browser. Firefox is the easiest browser to use for testing since it provides standalone proxy configuration. Other common browsers rely on OS level configuration for proxies and tend to cause more issues for students.

DNS is a powerful and rather complex system that plays a variety of crucial roles in modern systems and applications. It is so central to these systems that any degradation of service will severely impact the usability of a network-connected computer or mobile device (e.g., resulting in extremely slow boot and application launch times). Our objective is to gain a functional understanding of the system, which we can apply broadly to our work in other areas of the informatics domain. The following videos provide a highly accessible starting point. Pieter Explains Tech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlZC4Jwf3xQ Khan Academy https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro/internet-works-intro/v/the-internet-ip-addresses-and-dns DNS Namespace and Zones \u00b6 As you've seen, domain names are structured in a hierarchical manner that reflects the decentralized nature of the domain name system. The DNS namespace can be represented by a tree, with branches descending from a common root. A fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) is written by concatenating labels from left-to-right, tracing the path from a leaf node to the root by way of the parent nodes. A trailing dot, representative of the root, is appended to the FQDN for DNS operations though it is omitted in most user-facing applications. Below the root, the top-most level of the graph represents top-level domains (TLD), such as com, net, and edu, that appear at the end of every FQDN. IANA and its parent organization ICANN oversee the governance of the DNS root and top-level domains, though it delegates registration functions and operation of root and TLD name servers to independent organizations. Names appearing as children of each TLD are assigned to organizations through the domain registration process. An organization registers a domain name by working with an ICANN-accredited registrar or a reseller subcontracted by an accredited registrar. https://whois.icann.org/en/domain-name-registration-process Further subdivisions of the registered namespace can be created by the registrant. These subdomains appear as children of the registrant domains in the DNS tree described previously. DNS Zones \u00b6 The hierarchical structure of DNS lends to dividing administrative responsibility of the global namespace. The term \"zone\" refers to these administrative divisions. Each zone in DNS is a contiguous portion of the namespace under the administrative responsibility of a single manager. While zones are often aligned with individual domain registrations, the relationship is not one-to-one. A zone may include multiple domains. Likewise, a domain may be divided into additional zones encapsulating distinct subtrees. The root zone database is managed by IANA and contains the authority records for the TLDs. Likewise, IANA assigns operators for the TLDs. These operators maintain the authoritative database of all domain names and authority records registered in the TLD. These databases are referred to as the DNS registries and can be queried to identify the authoritative nameservers for child zones. DNS Name Servers \u00b6 Each zone, including the root, is hosted by one or more name servers that store collection of resource records associated with the corresponding subset of the DNS namespace. The primary service of root name servers and TLD name servers is to provide information about where to query the next level of the namespace. Roots point to TLD name servers and TLDs point to authoritative name servers for second-level domains. The primary records served by these servers are NS records along with A/AAAA glue records that identify the IP addresses for the provided servers. Likewise, the root and TLD servers distribute records related to DNS Security (DNSSEC) mechanisms. In addition to the root servers and TLD servers described above, resource records for each zone are hosted by at least one authoritative name server. These authoritative name servers may be hosted by the registrant itself or by a third-party DNS hosting service. Many organizations maintain internal, private zones serving records that are only available within well-defined network boundaries. Not all name servers are authoritative for a zone. Plenty of servers are created to satisfy service requirements for performance, redundancy, or security. Recursive name servers are used by clients to resolve DNS requests without having to perform iterative queries of root, TLD, and registrant name servers. When a recursive name server receives a query that it cannot resolve independently, it queries the upper-level zones to find the answer that it returns to the original client. This process can be sped up significantly by caching results, though care must be observed to prevent serving stale records from a cache. https://www.lifewire.com/dns-root-name-servers-3971336 https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers http://root-servers.org Redundancy and Reliability \u00b6 The modern internet is heavily dependent on DNS, so much so that DNS disruptions and failures can take businesses and users offline. Even seemingly minor performance issues can multiply and cause noticeable delays for networking operations. To combat these issues, many DNS service providers rely heavily on IPv4/v6 Anycast to ensure that a fleet of servers are available to answer queries. These service providers leverage BGP, the dynamic routing protocol of the Internet to assign the same IP address, e.g., 1.1.1.1, to each of their servers scattered around the world. Each DNS request that passes through the Internet will be routed to exactly one of these servers, typically the server that is closest to the sender. http://dyn.com/blog/unicast-vs-anycast-dns-nameserver-routing/ http://blog.catchpoint.com/2015/06/16/dns-anycast/ Protocol \u00b6 As the prior sections have suggested, the DNS protocol is a query response protocol that is used to resolve IP addresses and other metadata stored in resource records based on DNS names. The protocol can be run atop both UDP and TCP for transport and uses port 53 in both cases. Basic DNS queries are most likely to be served over UDP, as this protocol provides the most efficient transport mechanism by avoiding the multi-round trip cost associated with the TCP handshake. The connection-oriented TCP protocol is most likely to be used for responses over 512 bytes to ensure that the message fits in a single datagram. Zone transfers used to transfer domain information between primary and secondary name servers are a common example of TCP-based DNS transactions. The DNS protocol itself is unicast, though a multicast version (mDNS) has been defined to support communication on local networks without the need for supporting infrastructure. Multicast DNS is served on port 5353 of the 224.0.0.251 multicast address. The mDNS protocol was popularized by Apple under the Bonjour trademark, but it has more recently made its way into the most popular mobile and desktop operating systems by way of zeroconf initiatives. Common Resource Record (RR) Types \u00b6 DNS-related RFCs define many different record types for general use and specific applications. We address the most common records here: Start of Authority (SOA) records identify the primary name server and administrator responsible for a given zone as well as version information and base parameters that impact communication between servers in a zone and caching of records related to the zone. Name Server (NS) records indicate which name servers are authoritative for a given zone. These records are also accompanied by so-called glue records that store the IP addresses associated with the server name stored in an NS. Address (A) records are among the most familiar DNS records. Their role is simple in that they associate the IPv4 address of a resource with the server's name. Address records are structured for forward lookup, i.e., resolving the address given the name. A similar, yet separate address record (AAAA) is defined to support IPv6-related queries. Canonical Name (CNAME) records are used to set aliases for existing DNS names rather than directly associating a name with an IP address. These records are commonly used when a resource is hosted by an organization other than the registrant itself and to avoid the necessity of maintaining static IP addresses for these resources. The hostname of a web site that runs on a service like SquareSpace or Wix is likely to point to a CNAME alias that can be resolved to an IP within the parent (service-provider's) domain. Text (TXT) records store additional information required by other protocols. Quite often, TXT records are created to demonstrate ownership of a certain namespace. This action is required, e.g., when attaching a private domain to a hosted service such as Office 365 or GSuite mail. TXT records are also used to store Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records leveraged by SMTP servers to combat email spam. Mail Exchange (MX) records point to SMTP servers for a domain, enabling other SMTP servers to locate and route mail between domains. Each MX record contains the FQDN for a mail host. An associated A (or AAAA) record must exist to resolve the hostname to an IP address. The MX record also contains a preference field, which is used to determine priority among multiple MX records. It is quite common to provide multiple MX records to balance load between mail servers and gain redundancy. Servers with smaller preference values are tried first, while clients are expected to choose randomly between servers with equal preference. The MX record is the starting point for mail configuration. To combat spam and fraud, most organizations will configure SMTP to check for additional records, such as the TXT-based SPF records. Read https://www.rackaid.com/blog/email-dns-records/ to learn more about these applications. Reverse DNS Pointer (PTR) records enable lookups from IPv4 address to hostnames. These reverse lookups are required, or at least recommended, for the proper operation of certain application-level protocols such as email. Additional Topics \u00b6 Tools \u00b6 Dig - https://help.dyn.com/how-to-use-binds-dig-tool/ Nslookup - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nslookup Whois - https://whois.icann.org/en/dns-and-whois-how-it-works Service Discovery \u00b6 Service (SRV) records are used in conjunction with application layer protocols to identify resources based on role or function rather than hostname. This application is known as Service Discovery (DNS-SD) and is described in RFC 6763. SRV records can be queried just like any other record, though they are identified by a distinct convention of _service._transport in place of a standard host name. Practically speaking, SRV records function much like a general purpose MX pointing to named address records that can be further queried to obtain the IP address for a resource. $ dig -t srv _sip._tls.microsoft.com ; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> srv _sip._tls.microsoft.com ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 33094 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1 ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;_sip._tls.microsoft.com.

The database is independent of any single network or entity. The load of DNS queries is distributed broadly across many different servers. Clients can query servers that are geographically close to them, reducing overall time for name resolution. Moreover, DNS can withstand many types of failures and disruptions and resists many types of broad scale interference. Nevertheless, DNS has some significant limitations in the realm of security and privacy that are important to understand. In standard DNS, queries and responses are neither encrypted nor authenticated. Targeted manipulation of DNS responses, e.g., spoofing, can be used to direct victims to attacker-controlled resources or to inject advertisements into user traffic. http://erichelgeson.github.io/blog/2013/12/31/i-fought-my-isps-bad-behavior-and-won/ Likewise, passive monitoring reveals significant amounts of information about a victim's identity, beyond just telling us which server they have visited. This type of monitoring is often conducted by network administrators, ISPs, governments, passive observers on wireless networks, and hackers who have managed to hijack network traffic through a MITM attack. https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/10/05/unmasking-tor-users-with-dns/ https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+-+The+Problem This is a double-edged sword. The same properties of DNS can make it a powerful tool for detecting and preventing malicious attacks. The Cisco Umbrella service (originally OpenDNS), for example, can detect malware infections, phishing scams, and more through sophisticated analysis of DNS queries ( https://umbrella.cisco.com/ ). One approach to securing DNS against privacy incursions is to use a resolver that encrypts connections between clients and recursive servers. The dnscrypt project ( https://dnscrypt.org/ ) provides such a tool, though it is not supported by the vast majority of public DNS servers. More than privacy, the integrity of DNS is arguably the primary concern for most applications. DNSSEC provides a basic integrity mechanism akin to the public key infrastructure and X.509 certificates that underly SSL. DNSSEC is a complex topic and controversial topic. https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/ For most users, the most important thing to remember about DNS security is to take steps to protect records under their own purview. Basic DNS security hygiene involves the following tasks: Choosing trustworthy and secure DNS providers Keep DNS registrations active so that attackers cannot hijack the expired domain Limiting access to zone management accounts Implementing strong passwords and secondary authentication mechanisms It's difficult to overstate the importance of these practices. Attackers target DNS to hijack web traffic, entire email systems, and more. For this reason, applications are often deployed with higher-layer integrity mechanisms, e.g., X.509 certificates used in SSL and fingerprinting / key pinning in SSH.

DNS is a powerful and rather complex system that plays a variety of crucial roles in modern systems and applications. It is so central to these systems that any degradation of service will severely impact the usability of a network-connected computer or mobile device (e.g., resulting in extremely slow boot and application launch times). Our objective is to gain a functional understanding of the system, which we can apply broadly to our work in other areas of the informatics domain. The following videos provide a highly accessible starting point.

The DNS namespace can be represented by a tree, with branches descending from a common root. A fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) is written by concatenating labels from left-to-right, tracing the path from a leaf node to the root by way of the parent nodes. A trailing dot, representative of the root, is appended to the FQDN for DNS operations though it is omitted in most user-facing applications. Below the root, the top-most level of the graph represents top-level domains (TLD), such as com, net, and edu, that appear at the end of every FQDN. IANA and its parent organization ICANN oversee the governance of the DNS root and top-level domains, though it delegates registration functions and operation of root and TLD name servers to independent organizations. Names appearing as children of each TLD are assigned to organizations through the domain registration process. An organization registers a domain name by working with an ICANN-accredited registrar or a reseller subcontracted by an accredited registrar. https://whois.icann.org/en/domain-name-registration-process Further subdivisions of the registered namespace can be created by the registrant. These subdomains appear as children of the registrant domains in the DNS tree described previously.","title":"DNS Namespace and Zones"},{"location":"notes/dns-overview/#dns-zones","text":"The hierarchical structure of DNS lends to dividing administrative responsibility of the global namespace. The term \"zone\" refers to these administrative divisions. Each zone in DNS is a contiguous portion of the namespace under the administrative responsibility of a single manager. While zones are often aligned with individual domain registrations, the relationship is not one-to-one. A zone may include multiple domains. Likewise, a domain may be divided into additional zones encapsulating distinct subtrees. The root zone database is managed by IANA and contains the authority records for the TLDs. Likewise, IANA assigns operators for the TLDs. These operators maintain the authoritative database of all domain names and authority records registered in the TLD. These databases are referred to as the DNS registries and can be queried to identify the authoritative nameservers for child zones.","title":"DNS Zones"},{"location":"notes/dns-overview/#dns-name-servers","text":"Each zone, including the root, is hosted by one or more name servers that store collection of resource records associated with the corresponding subset of the DNS namespace. The primary service of root name servers and TLD name servers is to provide information about where to query the next level of the namespace. Roots point to TLD name servers and TLDs point to authoritative name servers for second-level domains. The primary records served by these servers are NS records along with A/AAAA glue records that identify the IP addresses for the provided servers. Likewise, the root and TLD servers distribute records related to DNS Security (DNSSEC) mechanisms. In addition to the root servers and TLD servers described above, resource records for each zone are hosted by at least one authoritative name server. These authoritative name servers may be hosted by the registrant itself or by a third-party DNS hosting service. Many organizations maintain internal, private zones serving records that are only available within well-defined network boundaries. Not all name servers are authoritative for a zone. Plenty of servers are created to satisfy service requirements for performance, redundancy, or security. Recursive name servers are used by clients to resolve DNS requests without having to perform iterative queries of root, TLD, and registrant name servers. When a recursive name server receives a query that it cannot resolve independently, it queries the upper-level zones to find the answer that it returns to the original client. This process can be sped up significantly by caching results, though care must be observed to prevent serving stale records from a cache. https://www.lifewire.com/dns-root-name-servers-3971336 https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers http://root-servers.org","title":"DNS Name Servers"},{"location":"notes/dns-overview/#redundancy-and-reliability","text":"The modern internet is heavily dependent on DNS, so much so that DNS disruptions and failures can take businesses and users offline. Even seemingly minor performance issues can multiply and cause noticeable delays for networking operations. To combat these issues, many DNS service providers rely heavily on IPv4/v6 Anycast to ensure that a fleet of servers are available to answer queries. These service providers leverage BGP, the dynamic routing protocol of the Internet to assign the same IP address, e.g., 1.1.1.1, to each of their servers scattered around the world. Each DNS request that passes through the Internet will be routed to exactly one of these servers, typically the server that is closest to the sender. http://dyn.com/blog/unicast-vs-anycast-dns-nameserver-routing/ http://blog.catchpoint.com/2015/06/16/dns-anycast/","title":"Redundancy and Reliability"},{"location":"notes/dns-overview/#protocol","text":"As the prior sections have suggested, the DNS protocol is a query response protocol that is used to resolve IP addresses and other metadata stored in resource records based on DNS names. The protocol can be run atop both UDP and TCP for transport and uses port 53 in both cases. Basic DNS queries are most likely to be served over UDP, as this protocol provides the most efficient transport mechanism by avoiding the multi-round trip cost associated with the TCP handshake. The connection-oriented TCP protocol is most likely to be used for responses over 512 bytes to ensure that the message fits in a single datagram. Zone transfers used to transfer domain information between primary and secondary name servers are a common example of TCP-based DNS transactions. The DNS protocol itself is unicast, though a multicast version (mDNS) has been defined to support communication on local networks without the need for supporting infrastructure. Multicast DNS is served on port 5353 of the 224.0.0.251 multicast address. The mDNS protocol was popularized by Apple under the Bonjour trademark, but it has more recently made its way into the most popular mobile and desktop operating systems by way of zeroconf initiatives.","title":"Protocol"},{"location":"notes/dns-overview/#common-resource-record-rr-types","text":"DNS-related RFCs define many different record types for general use and specific applications. We address the most common records here: Start of Authority (SOA) records identify the primary name server and administrator responsible for a given zone as well as version information and base parameters that impact communication between servers in a zone and caching of records related to the zone. Name Server (NS) records indicate which name servers are authoritative for a given zone. These records are also accompanied by so-called glue records that store the IP addresses associated with the server name stored in an NS. Address (A) records are among the most familiar DNS records. Their role is simple in that they associate the IPv4 address of a resource with the server's name. Address records are structured for forward lookup, i.e., resolving the address given the name. A similar, yet separate address record (AAAA) is defined to support IPv6-related queries. Canonical Name (CNAME) records are used to set aliases for existing DNS names rather than directly associating a name with an IP address. These records are commonly used when a resource is hosted by an organization other than the registrant itself and to avoid the necessity of maintaining static IP addresses for these resources. The hostname of a web site that runs on a service like SquareSpace or Wix is likely to point to a CNAME alias that can be resolved to an IP within the parent (service-provider's) domain. Text (TXT) records store additional information required by other protocols. Quite often, TXT records are created to demonstrate ownership of a certain namespace. This action is required, e.g., when attaching a private domain to a hosted service such as Office 365 or GSuite mail. TXT records are also used to store Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records leveraged by SMTP servers to combat email spam. Mail Exchange (MX) records point to SMTP servers for a domain, enabling other SMTP servers to locate and route mail between domains. Each MX record contains the FQDN for a mail host. An associated A (or AAAA) record must exist to resolve the hostname to an IP address. The MX record also contains a preference field, which is used to determine priority among multiple MX records. It is quite common to provide multiple MX records to balance load between mail servers and gain redundancy. Servers with smaller preference values are tried first, while clients are expected to choose randomly between servers with equal preference. The MX record is the starting point for mail configuration. To combat spam and fraud, most organizations will configure SMTP to check for additional records, such as the TXT-based SPF records. Read https://www.rackaid.com/blog/email-dns-records/ to learn more about these applications. Reverse DNS Pointer (PTR) records enable lookups from IPv4 address to hostnames.

The database is independent of any single network or entity. The load of DNS queries is distributed broadly across many different servers. Clients can query servers that are geographically close to them, reducing overall time for name resolution. Moreover, DNS can withstand many types of failures and disruptions and resists many types of broad scale interference. Nevertheless, DNS has some significant limitations in the realm of security and privacy that are important to understand. In standard DNS, queries and responses are neither encrypted nor authenticated. Targeted manipulation of DNS responses, e.g., spoofing, can be used to direct victims to attacker-controlled resources or to inject advertisements into user traffic. http://erichelgeson.github.io/blog/2013/12/31/i-fought-my-isps-bad-behavior-and-won/ Likewise, passive monitoring reveals significant amounts of information about a victim's identity, beyond just telling us which server they have visited.

The Cisco Umbrella service (originally OpenDNS), for example, can detect malware infections, phishing scams, and more through sophisticated analysis of DNS queries ( https://umbrella.cisco.com/ ). One approach to securing DNS against privacy incursions is to use a resolver that encrypts connections between clients and recursive servers. The dnscrypt project ( https://dnscrypt.org/ ) provides such a tool, though it is not supported by the vast majority of public DNS servers. More than privacy, the integrity of DNS is arguably the primary concern for most applications. DNSSEC provides a basic integrity mechanism akin to the public key infrastructure and X.509 certificates that underly SSL. DNSSEC is a complex topic and controversial topic. https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/ For most users, the most important thing to remember about DNS security is to take steps to protect records under their own purview.

Barring advanced configurations, devices that are attached through switching infrastructure are part of the same layer-2 network and can communicate directy through the switch using layer-2 addresses. Collisions and Media Access Control \u00b6 Switches are not the only layer-2 game in town for wired Ethernet, though they are one of the few you should even consider in 2020. Once upon a time we connected devices in a bus configuration, where each node would tap into a segment of coaxial cable or other suitable transmission medium. In this configuration, the bus provides a resource that must be shared between all nodes attached to it. One consequence of this configuration is that data frames are visible to every other node since the signal is transmitted across the entire bus. Likewise, since the bus is shared, collisions between data frames may occur when nodes try to use the resource at the same time. For this reason, we say that bus represents a single collision domain . Ethernet copes with collisions using a media access control (MAC) mechanism that allows the NIC to identify a failure and make another attempt after a variable delay. This mechanism is known as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) . While CSMA/CD enables the network to continue functioning despite collisions, congestion occur as the shared medium becomes more contested. A highly congested network is inefficient since failures and retransmission consume an increasing amount of its bandwidth. Star Topology \u00b6 Congestion is not the only architectural concern associated with the bus topology. Physical challenges such as signal interference and attenuation limit the overall length of a bus. As such, the layout of the bus relative to the physical location of each node must be carefully planned. Hubs alleviated these latter concerns by offering a more flexible topology. In a star topology , multiple nodes connect back to a central point through dedicated, indepenent links, e.g., lengths of CAT-5 cable. Beneath the hood, hubs still operate on the underlying principle of transmitting signals across an entire network segment. In fact, each port of a hub acts as a repeater for the physical signals that were received on other ports. As such, hubs do not eliminate the concern of congestion and collisions or snooping on communication within a segment since endpoints connected by hubs are still members of a single collision domain. Bridging and Switches \u00b6 Bridging provide a layer-2 solution to the congestion problem by splitting a network into independent collision domains and intelligently forwarding frames between these layer-2 segments . When a bridge observes a frame on one of its ports, it inspects Ethernet headers to learn about the topology of the network based on the MAC address of the sender. The bridge uses the information it learns about the topology to optimize forwarding, which is only necessary when the recipient and sender are on different segments. xxx NO CHANGES TO ETHERNET Classic Ethernet bridges provides two ports/collision domains and are rarely seen in modern networks. A switch combines multiple bridges in a device that physically resembles a hub. Unlike a hub, however, each switch port represents a distinct segment on its own collision domain. From a performance perspective, a well-placed bridge can reduce the amount of activity on a domain by about half (discounting for broadcast traffic). Adding more bridges further improves the situation. In a switched network, every link is isolated within an independent collision domain, allowing a much greater level of overall throughput on the network. Forwarding Mechanics \u00b6 The forwarding mechanics of a switch are identical to a bridge. As switches learn the topology of a layer-2 network, they populate a Forwarding Information Base (FIB) with MAC/port associations. Until a switch knows which port is associated with a particular destination MAC address, a frame received on one port will be flooded over every other port on the switch. Broadcast Domains \u00b6 As we've seen, switches support standard Ethernet modes of communication between all nodes of the layer-2 network based on MAC address. Virtual LAN (VLAN) \u00b6 VLANs provide a solution to isolate broadcast domains from one another without requiring an investment of dedicated hardware for each domain. In the simplest sense, VLANs provide virtual separation of broadcast domains by identifying switch ports as VLAN members and referencing this configuration to enforce the separation of ethernet traffic. A switch configured with more than one VLAN behaves like multiple standalone switches. The ports assigned to a given VLAN maintain their own view of the FIB that is based only on the MAC addresses seen on those ports. In port-based VLANs, which use the mode of operation described above, a router would need to be attached to each set of ports to assign forwarding across the VLAN boundary. Many switches, support a more dynamic mode that enables network-attached devices to distinguish between traffic from multiple VLANs running over a single link. Links that carry traffic for multiple VLANs are called trunks (the associated switch ports are called trunk ports). With trunking, connections between infrastructure components is simplified since multiple broadcast domains can be collapsed onto a single physical link. Trunks generally rely on tags (as specified in 802.1q) to control distribution of frames over VLANs. Despite implementation differences, tag and port-based VLANs obey the same rules. Layer-2 frames received on any port/tag are only distributed within the associated VLAN. Switch Architecture Planning \u00b6 Larger networks require multi-tier switch deployments to satisfy the requirements of core communication, distribution, and network access. Switches at the access tier need to provide enough port density to support endpoints in the network. Switches participating in the distribution tier of the network architecture may prioritize VLAN trunking, basic redundancy, and incorporate layer-3 functionality to handle routing and security policies internally. Core functionality will likely incorporate multiple levels of redundancy and higher capacity links. Redundancy and Switch Loops \u00b6 Redundancy is a common requirement in network infrastructure for the corporate world. Organizations have a greater dependence on information technology and a low threshold for system outages that disrupt operations or productivity. In LAN design, we need to plan for redundant components and links based on the impact of a failure at a given point in the network. Redundancy at this layer has an interesting effect with regard to forwarding behavior. A frame that passes through one side of a redundant connection is expected to return to the switch through the other side of the connection. This situation is commonly known as a switching loop. Frames that are caught in a loop degrade the performance of the switches involved. Broadcast traffic exacerbates the problem and may create a broadcast storm. Spanning tree protocol (STP) is present on many business-grade switches to alleviate this problem. FIBs sometimes referred to as a MAC address table or a CAM table. CAM stands for content addressable memory, which is the implementation mechanism used for the FIB on many switches. \u21a9","title":"Ethernet Switches"},{"location":"notes/ethernet-switches/#introduction","text":"Ethernet switches are one of the most widely deployed network components, providing physical ports for attaching other network components or endpoints at the data-link layer of the TCP/IP stack.

Let\u2019s take a step back and review the fundamentals. What is a Router \u00b6 A router is a computing device that is attached to two or more networks and is set up so that it can forward packets from one network to another. Both of these conditions are necessary in order for us to call something a router. You might think that all routers are special purpose, embedded devices like the ones you see on most home or office networks. In reality, most computers 1 are capable of routing, so long as the hardware supports multiple network connections and the software supports forwarding between networks. Routers vs Multi-homed Hosts \u00b6 It is not uncommon for a device to be connected to multiple networks without being configured to route traffic. A device with this configuration, e.g., your Pi prior to checkpoint #3, is known as a multi-homed host. A non-routing, multi-homed hosts will drop packets that aren\u2019t directly addressed to it at both Layer-2 (MAC address) and Layer-3 (IP address). This behavior is exactly the same as an ordinary host attached to a single network. Routers and Incoming Packets \u00b6 On an ethernet-based network, a router will process any frame for which the destination MAC address matches the MAC of the NIC on which the frame was received. After processing Layer-2, the router examines the packet\u2019s IP headers. Assuming that the destination IP address is not a match for the router\u2019s IP address, the router will consult its route table in order to forward the packet closer to its final destination. Packets addressed directly to the router will continue to be processed so that they can be delivered to an internal process via a socket. Routers and Outgoing Packets \u00b6 Most of the unique magic that distinguishes routers from ordinary hosts takes place on inbound packets. You might be surprised to learn that the process of sending a packet is the same for packets from local applications as it is for packets forwarded between networks. No matter where a packet comes from or where it is going, packet-communication occurs on a hop-by-hop basis. Every host starts this process by comparing its destination address to entries defined in its own routing table. Matches are identified when the network bits of the destination match a network id in the based on the correspondence netmask or CIDR defined in the routing table 2 . After finding a match, the network stack can start the process of forwarding to the next hop. If the final destination is on a directly attached network, ARP is used to determine the MAC address of the destination and the packet will be forwarded directly. Otherwise, the routing table can be used to find a next hop IP address for a directly attached network. Once again, with the next hop IP, ARP can be used to determine the MAC address so that the packet can be forwarded directly. Terminology \u00b6 Routing terminology is a common sticking point for many students and professionals. In particular, it can be useful to understand the finer distinctions between the terms routing and forwarding . At Layer-3, the word forwarding describes the mechanics of passing an inbound packet from its origin interface back onto a different network through an outbound interface. The mechanics of finding a matching route and pushing the packet out the appropriate interface are all part of the forwarding process. In contrast, routing refers to the entire end-to-end process that gets a packet to the right place. When we say most computers, we mean it. Have you ever used your mobile phone as a hotspot for your tablet or computer? Give it a shot, and if you\u2019re able, use traceroute or tracert to observe the routing process in action. \u21a9 It is possible for a routing table to find multiple matches. In this case, ties are broken by looking for the most specific entry, i.e., the longest matching network prefix. Other metrics may be used if there are multiple entries for a given network ID. \u21a9","title":"Routers"},{"location":"notes/router-overview/#routers","text":"Routers and routing are frequent topics when we discuss networking, and it is all too easy for newcomers to overlook or misunderstand some of the assumptions we make about these terms.

In reality, most computers 1 are capable of routing, so long as the hardware supports multiple network connections and the software supports forwarding between networks.","title":"What is a Router"},{"location":"notes/router-overview/#routers-vs-multi-homed-hosts","text":"It is not uncommon for a device to be connected to multiple networks without being configured to route traffic. A device with this configuration, e.g., your Pi prior to checkpoint #3, is known as a multi-homed host. A non-routing, multi-homed hosts will drop packets that aren\u2019t directly addressed to it at both Layer-2 (MAC address) and Layer-3 (IP address). This behavior is exactly the same as an ordinary host attached to a single network.","title":"Routers vs Multi-homed Hosts"},{"location":"notes/router-overview/#routers-and-incoming-packets","text":"On an ethernet-based network, a router will process any frame for which the destination MAC address matches the MAC of the NIC on which the frame was received. After processing Layer-2, the router examines the packet\u2019s IP headers. Assuming that the destination IP address is not a match for the router\u2019s IP address, the router will consult its route table in order to forward the packet closer to its final destination. Packets addressed directly to the router will continue to be processed so that they can be delivered to an internal process via a socket.","title":"Routers and Incoming Packets"},{"location":"notes/router-overview/#routers-and-outgoing-packets","text":"Most of the unique magic that distinguishes routers from ordinary hosts takes place on inbound packets. You might be surprised to learn that the process of sending a packet is the same for packets from local applications as it is for packets forwarded between networks. No matter where a packet comes from or where it is going, packet-communication occurs on a hop-by-hop basis. Every host starts this process by comparing its destination address to entries defined in its own routing table. Matches are identified when the network bits of the destination match a network id in the based on the correspondence netmask or CIDR defined in the routing table 2 . After finding a match, the network stack can start the process of forwarding to the next hop. If the final destination is on a directly attached network, ARP is used to determine the MAC address of the destination and the packet will be forwarded directly. Otherwise, the routing table can be used to find a next hop IP address for a directly attached network. Once again, with the next hop IP, ARP can be used to determine the MAC address so that the packet can be forwarded directly.","title":"Routers and Outgoing Packets"},{"location":"notes/router-overview/#terminology","text":"Routing terminology is a common sticking point for many students and professionals. In particular, it can be useful to understand the finer distinctions between the terms routing and forwarding . At Layer-3, the word forwarding describes the mechanics of passing an inbound packet from its origin interface back onto a different network through an outbound interface. The mechanics of finding a matching route and pushing the packet out the appropriate interface are all part of the forwarding process. In contrast, routing refers to the entire end-to-end process that gets a packet to the right place. When we say most computers, we mean it. Have you ever used your mobile phone as a hotspot for your tablet or computer? Give it a shot, and if you\u2019re able, use traceroute or tracert to observe the routing process in action. \u21a9 It is possible for a routing table to find multiple matches. In this case, ties are broken by looking for the most specific entry, i.e., the longest matching network prefix. Other metrics may be used if there are multiple entries for a given network ID. \u21a9","title":"Terminology"},{"location":"resources/address-planning/","text":"Basic IP Address Planning (2022-04-04) \u00b6 Don't try to build a network without a plan. A good network design is built on parameters and constraints that are appropriate for the intended use-cases. This guide offers a simple procedure that can serve as a starting point for basic planning with a single subnet network. Private versus Public \u00b6 We can't pull addresses from thin air. The laws of the TCP/IP universe restrict what addresses we can use on networks we can control. Make sure that you understand where addresses come from and can distinguish between private and public address space. Private Address Ranges Within the boundaries of our own network, we are relatively free to set our rules as long as we use addresses that are reserved for private use. Your reference point for these addresses is RFC-1918 . Public Address Ranges For packets we send on the public Internet, we must use public addresses that are in our control. These addresses will either be leased (short-term or long-term reservation) to us by an ISP or allocated on a more permanent basis by a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) 1 . A contiguous group of addresses allocated in this way is referred to as a block . Special Address Ranges Beyond these two ranges, we frequently encounter other address ranges that are reserved for special use-cases, e.g., the loopback (127.0.0.0/8) and link-local (169.254.0.0/16) address ranges. RFC-6890 Configuration Strategies \u00b6 As you get started, you will need to make decisions about how you will configure devices on your network with appropriate IP addresses and network parameters. Before you proceed, make sure that you understand the following classifications. Leased Addresses As much as possible, you'll want to avoid the need for manual configuration when a new device joins the network. DHCP allows you to allocate a range of addresses that the server can use to issue address leases to hosts that request them. Leased addresses are dynamic in the sense that they aren't determined until a host joins the network and initiates the DHCP process. Static Addresses Dynamic address assignment won't work for every scenario, e.g., when an address should be fixed and a dependency on DHCP isn't possible. Some devices, including your network gateway and the DHCP server itself should be manually configured. We describe their addresses as static because they are defined through the network node's own configuration and won't change based on external factors. Procedure \u00b6 Step 1 - Examine address needs \u00b6 Determine the size of your network, i.e., the number of devices that will need addresses at any given point in time, and document the types of devices you expect to service as well as their address requirements. Don't forget to account for network infrastructure and additional growth. Not all devices on a network are the same, and so you will often have clients with different address needs. End users on their computers and mobile devices will almost always receive dynamic (leased) addresses, but you might need to reserve some address space for static addresses to acommodate web servers, mail servers, or even (sometimes) printers. Your network infrastructure consists of routers, essential services like DHCP and DNS, as well as managed switches and access points. In very simple networks, these services may live on the same device and share a single IP address. More sophisticated networks will split these services onto dedicated devices, or at the very least, assign them dedicated IP addresses. Always assume that your network will grow over time. Allocate additional address space in anticipation of this growth. If you have believe that you will need 30 addresses today, it's probably safer to plan for at least 60 addresses. Step 2 - Identify the base address range \u00b6 Identify the base address range from which you will be subnetting. If you do not have a permanent allocation, select a block from the RFC-1918 address range. Step 3 - Select subnet parameters \u00b6 Based on the inventory you conducted in step #1, determine the number of address bits that are required in order to give an address to each host on your LAN. You can use this number to determine the CIDR length and network mask for your Subnet. Given a base network and a CIDR length, choose an available subnet id for your network. 2 To complete the set of basic configuration parameters, compute the broadcast address associated with your chosen subnet ID and CIDR. Step 4 - Document important addresses and ranges \u00b6 Finally, identify how you plan to allocate the addresses in your network among devices based on the requirements you identified in Step #1. Static addresses will usually be assigned to core network devices, such as your router, DHCP, and DNS servers. If you identified any other devices that need consistent addresses, assign those addresses now. When you operate multiple networks, it is helpful to be consistent with your static assignments. For example, most network administrators will assign the router to either the first or last address in the subnet. Don't deviate from convention unless you have a good reason. Once you've documented your static addresses, identify a range of addresses within your subnet that can be used for the DHCP address pool. This should be a contiguous block of addresses that does not overlap with your a) network ID, b) subnet's broadcast address, or c) static addresses that you already defined. More information about RIRs can be found at https://www.nro.net/about/rirs/ . \u21a9 The subnet ID or network prefix is the portion of the address that stays the same for all hosts on the same layer-2 network segment. \u21a9","title":"Basic IP Address Planning"},{"location":"resources/address-planning/#basic-ip-address-planning-2022-04-04","text":"Don't try to build a network without a plan.

These parameters can differ somewhat depending on the type of link you use, i.e., physical or tunnel-based, and other constraints. This guide presents two different scenarios: a) VLANs over a physical Ethernet connection and b) WireGuard to establish a tunnel-link between two routers. In all cases, we need an Autonomous System Number (ASN) for each Autonomous System and we need a unique IP address that will identify each router (regardless of which interface is used). This latter parameter is called the router ID. For each routing link, we also need to provide a way for the routing peers to deliver packets from host-to-host -- implying the use of IP addresses. Free Range Routing (FRR) supports an \"unnumbered\" address configuration which saves us the trouble of planning out addresses on the links; however, this configuration depends on link-local IPv6 capabilities that won't work as expected over a WireGuard tunnel. In these cases, BGP can make use of peer-to-peer addresses configured on the WireGuard network interfaces. !!! \"example\" Configuration Parameters for VLAN-based peers over Ethernet - Interface for routing link: vlan10 - Autonomous System Number (ASN): 65009 (local) peering to 65000 (remote) - Router ID: 172.27.2.1 - Advertise Network(s): 172.27.2.0/24 !!! \"example\" Configuration Parameters for VPN-based peers - Interface for routing link: vpn0 - Tunnel IP's: 10.99.0.3 (local) to 10.99.0.2 (remote) - Autonomous System Number (ASN): 65009 (local) peering to 65000 (remote) - Router ID: 172.27.2.1 - Advertise Network(s): 172.27.2.0/24 Preparing Interfaces for the \"Unnumbered\" BGP Configuration \u00b6 !!! \"attention\" Ethernet Only This section does not apply to routing configuration over WireGuard VPN links To begin, we need to prepare the interface that we'll be using to peer with neighboring routers. In the past, this would have meant configuring IPv4 addresses for each side of the connection; however, we will be taking advantage of unnumbered BGP to identify and connect to our peers based on auto-configured IPv6 addresses. This simplification is welcome since the addresses we assign on point-to-point routing links generally serve no purpose other than facilitating communication between the adjacent routers. Our main task is to enable auto-configuration for IPv6 and to disable auto-configuration privacy extensions so that our MAC address will be encoded into the link-local IPv6 address for the interface. We also need to ensure that the routing interface will listen for and accept ICMPv6 router advertisements from its peer. Configure interface \u00b6 Create or edit a networkd .network configuration for the routing link, e.g., /etc/systemd/network/24-vlan10.network and ensure that the following IPv6 settings are in place. No IPv4 configuration will be performed on this link.

Though we could use any one of our directly attached addresses, it is common to configure an ID on the loopback interface of the network device to ensure that it is available regardless of link status -- static addresses attached to physical interfaces are offline when the link is down.

We previously configured our interface to accept these messages, but we still need to set up the routing daemon to generate the messages on the specified interface. The following commands will turn on ICMPv6 router advertisements and set an interval of one advertisement every 5 seconds (as recommended by FRR documentation). Enter the following commands in the VTY shell: configure terminal interface vlan10 ipv6 nd ra-interval 5 no ipv6 nd suppress-ra quit Configure BGP Routing \u00b6 Once the preliminary configuration is complete, we can setup the BGP daemon to peer on the specified interface. The following examples provide the VTYSH commands needed to enable a new router in ASN 65009 to peer with a neighboring autonomous system and advertises routes for 172.27.2.0/24.

Exit out of configure mode, if necessary, and call copy running-config startup-config or write memory .

You should read the entire guide carefully before attempting to install the template or any of the other tools referenced here. Tables, Chains, and Rule Syntax \u00b6 Iptables is a tool that has been used for more than 20 years to allow administrators to manage packet filter rules that shape the behavior of the Linux kernel's network stack. Tables \u00b6 Iptables uses a basic structure called a table to group rules according to their main function. Common tables include nat , filter , mangle , and raw . For this exercise, we'll focus on the nat table to implement address translation between private and public addresses along with the filter table to protect our network from outside traffic. Chains \u00b6 Within each table, rules are assigned to a structure called a chain. A chain is nothing more than an ordered list of rules. Rule conditions are tested in order from the beginning of the chain. Each rule ends with an action. If the conditions of a rule match, iptables will apply the specified action or jump to another chain without processing the other rules. If conditions do not match, the next rule in the chain will be evaluated. The default chains correspond to different points in the packet lifecycle. Within the filter table, we will often work with the INPUT , OUTPUT , and FORWARD chains. These chains correspond to packets sent to the host ( INPUT ), packets being sent by the host ( OUTPUT ), and packets being routed through the host ( FORWARD ). Within the nat table, our focus will be on the POSTROUTING chain. This chain represents the last set of rules that will be evaluated before forwarding a filtered packet. This is where we want to apply address mappings related to SNAT and masquerading. In contrast, the PREROUTING chain is applied before any other process and is used to specify DNAT rules. For a more detailed exploration of the chains we have discussed, see Understanding Netfilter/Iptables Hooks . Managing Rules from the Command Line \u00b6 We can load a set of iptables rules from a file or manage them directly from the command line with the iptables command ( sudo is required). As we explain the structure of rules, we will provide examples using the command line variant of iptables rule syntax. The first component of a rule specified from the command line is the table name. Specify the table using the -t option to the iptables command . If you don't specify a table explicitly, the filter table will be used by default. When working with rules via the command line, we have to work with rules one at a time and specify the order of operations as we go. Recall from the last section that the order of rules in a chain is significant. We can append new rules to the end of a chain using the -A option or insert rules at the beginning of a chain using -I . Likewise, we can delete a rule from a chain by specifying -D and providing a numeric index to the rule. Copy/Paste Warning These are examples only. Keep reading to learn how to build complete rules. Example: Appending Rules Append a rule to the end of the POSTROUTING chain of the nat table ... iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING <conditions> <actions> Example: Deleting Rules Delete the first rule from the FORWARD chain of filter iptables -D FORWARD 1 Customize Rules with Filter Conditions \u00b6 In addition to specifying table and chain, our rules need to describe the criteria associated with packets we want to filter or manipulate. In this exercise, our primary consideration is the direction of traffic for a given packet, which we describe by specifying the ingress and/or egress interface for a given packet. Attention Throughout the instructions, we'll refer to the internal interface as our <LAN> (because it serves our local network) and the external interface as the <WAN> (because it connects us to the Internet). Your configuration files will reflect the system assigned interface names, such as: eth0 and wlan0 . It's up to you to determine, based on your learning so far, which interface corresponds to which placeholder. For example, we want to apply address translation to outbound packets, i.e., packets being forwarded in the <LAN> interface and out the <WAN> interface. We can specify this restriction in our nat rule by providing the -o option with the name of the outbound interface. Likewise, we can instruct iptables to look at packets coming from the <LAN> and to the <WAN> by combining the -i option with -o in our filter rules. Copy/Paste Warning These are examples only. Keep reading to learn how to build complete rules. Example: Adding filter conditions to rules This NAT rule will be applied on outbound traffic that's being routed to the WAN network. iptables -t NAT -A POSTROUTING -o <WAN> <actions> Example: Combining multiple filters The following filter rule will be applied to outbound traffic that's being forwarded from the LAN to the WAN. iptables -A FORWARD -i <LAN> -o <WAN> <actions> Using Connection State in Rules \u00b6 Iptables is stateful , meaning that it is even possible to specify rules based on the relationship of a packet to other packets that were processed by iptables. This feature shapes our rules in two ways. First, you'll notice that we only have to specify the masquerade rule in the outward direction. The same rule also handles the de-masquerading process for incoming packets. Second, you'll see that we can base filtering decisions on connection state itself. While it's appropriate for NAT routers to allow outgoing traffic, we typically want to place greater restrictions on incoming traffic. When configuring a gateway connection for a home or office, we often block incoming traffic unless it relates to existing connections from the LAN. Unsolicited traffic does not make sense in this context and poses a security risk. To accomplish this feat, we will make use of netfilter's connection tracking extensions which are specified with the -m conntrack and --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED options. Copy/Paste Warning These are examples only. Keep reading to learn how to build complete rules. Example: Using the connection tracking extension Check the connection state of ingress traffic. iptables -A FORWARD -i <WAN> -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED <action> Specify an Action \u00b6 The last component of an iptables rule is specified using the -j option. In a simple configuration, this option provides the action to be carried out against the packet after the match. While we will encounter the MASQUERADE option in our NAT rules, we will more frequently with basic ACCEPT and DROP rules within the filter context. In more complex configurations, -j can point to user-defined chains containing additional rules that relate to the pattern you just matched. As you gain experience, you'll see that this provides a greater degree of organization and control flow. Bringing this option together with the earlier examples, we can express complete rules using the following syntax: iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o <WAN> -j MASQUERADE iptables -A FORWARD -i <WAN> -o <LAN> -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT Default Actions \u00b6 We haven't yet said what will happen if your iptables chains complete without any matching rules. Each iptables chain defines a policy that specifies the default actions that will be taken if no other rule matches in a chain. Default policies are commonly used with the filter chains to implement a posture of failing securely, blocking traffic that wasn't explicitly allowed. # Don't forward packets unless there was an explicit rule match iptables -P FORWARD DROP Be careful, however, that you don't lock yourself out by a bad combination of rules and policies. For example, setting -P INPUT DROP and -P OUTPUT DROP will block all inbound and outbound traffic to your Pi unless you previously added rules to explicitly allow SSH or other tools that are needed for management purposes. Even when you correctly add these rules, it's relatively easy to lock yourself out of a device by flushing your current ruleset -- deleting the rules from all chains while leaving your policies intact. Final NAT Template \u00b6 The following template draws together all of the components we have discussed so far to define a basic NAT configuration for a Linux router. The syntax for this template differs somewhat from the commands we explored above. Rather than invoking each rule or policy in this file through the iptables command, this template would be applied via iptables-restore or iptables-apply . To prepare to use this template, save a copy of this template to the home directory (file name does not matter) of your Linux router. Pay close attention to the comments within the file, since they explain some of the differences in syntax. # Fill in the parameters in <> in order to complete the ruleset # Rules are given on a table-by-table basis, beginning with the *<table> and # ending with COMMIT. # Rules are appended to a chain using the -A <chain> syntax. Parameters vary # somewhat by chain and type of effect desired. # The -j switch instructs the rules engine to jump to another chain or perform # the action on the matched packet. The engine will not evaluate any more rules # in the given chain. # The default policy for a chain is given by the lines beginning with # :<chain>. The [0:0] resets the packet/byte counters that tell us how many # times the default policy has been applied. Note that default policy is # evaluated after all rules, so it only applies if there were not any matches. *nat -A POSTROUTING -o <interface> -j MASQUERADE COMMIT *filter :FORWARD <action> [0:0] -A FORWARD -i <interface> -o <interface> -j ACCEPT -A FORWARD -i <interface> -o <interface> -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j <action> COMMIT Loading rules from the file system with iptables-persistent \u00b6 For simplicity, we\u2019ll rely on on a collection of tools called iptables-persistent to test our rules and then load them automatically at boot. Here be Dragons Do not write rules directly to /etc/iptables/rules.v4 . If you do this, you risk creating a rule that locks you out of your device from the network. Without an external monitor and keyboard, you will not be able to bypass these changes since they are loaded at boot. We are presenting iptables-persistent to provide you with a tool that allows us you to apply new rules safely by testing changes before making them fully persistent. Like many other tools, iptables-persistent is available as a package in Debian's package repository. This package contains tools to help you test new rules and install them into the /etc/iptables/rules.v4 path so that they can be loaded automatically in the future. Use apt to install the iptables-persistent package before attempting the instructions below. Make a copy of your rules within your home directory (file name does not matter) and use the iptables-apply command as shown below to test that they work before writing them to /etc/iptables/rules.v4 . While it is possible to edit /etc/iptables/rules.v4 directly, we recomend against it. The following command will flush iptables and load the rules given in ~/untested_rules . After loading the rules, iptables-apply waits for 60 seconds while you confirm that you can still SSH into the device from a second terminal tab or window. If your rules work as intended, you need respond affirmatively at this final prompt within the time limit so that iptables-apply can write them to a permanent location. If you skip this step, iptables-apply will assume that your test failed and restore the old version of the rules. sudo iptables-apply -t 60 -w /etc/iptables/rules.v4 ~/untested_rules After running the command, you\u2019ll have one minute to check that everything is working and confirm that you\u2019re ready to apply the rules. If everything checks out, the rules will be written to /etc/iptables/rules.v4 (where iptables-persistent can load them at boot). If your connection is interrupted or you decide not to keep the rules, the rules will be reset when the timer expires so that you con continue to access your Pi. As a final test that your rules are loaded, reboot the Pi, connect with SSH, and list the rules with sudo iptables-save . If you don\u2019t see your rules, something went wrong.

A chain is nothing more than an ordered list of rules. Rule conditions are tested in order from the beginning of the chain. Each rule ends with an action. If the conditions of a rule match, iptables will apply the specified action or jump to another chain without processing the other rules. If conditions do not match, the next rule in the chain will be evaluated. The default chains correspond to different points in the packet lifecycle. Within the filter table, we will often work with the INPUT , OUTPUT , and FORWARD chains. These chains correspond to packets sent to the host ( INPUT ), packets being sent by the host ( OUTPUT ), and packets being routed through the host ( FORWARD ). Within the nat table, our focus will be on the POSTROUTING chain. This chain represents the last set of rules that will be evaluated before forwarding a filtered packet. This is where we want to apply address mappings related to SNAT and masquerading. In contrast, the PREROUTING chain is applied before any other process and is used to specify DNAT rules.

As we explain the structure of rules, we will provide examples using the command line variant of iptables rule syntax. The first component of a rule specified from the command line is the table name. Specify the table using the -t option to the iptables command . If you don't specify a table explicitly, the filter table will be used by default. When working with rules via the command line, we have to work with rules one at a time and specify the order of operations as we go. Recall from the last section that the order of rules in a chain is significant. We can append new rules to the end of a chain using the -A option or insert rules at the beginning of a chain using -I .

Attention Throughout the instructions, we'll refer to the internal interface as our <LAN> (because it serves our local network) and the external interface as the <WAN> (because it connects us to the Internet). Your configuration files will reflect the system assigned interface names, such as: eth0 and wlan0 . It's up to you to determine, based on your learning so far, which interface corresponds to which placeholder. For example, we want to apply address translation to outbound packets, i.e., packets being forwarded in the <LAN> interface and out the <WAN> interface. We can specify this restriction in our nat rule by providing the -o option with the name of the outbound interface.

The same rule also handles the de-masquerading process for incoming packets. Second, you'll see that we can base filtering decisions on connection state itself. While it's appropriate for NAT routers to allow outgoing traffic, we typically want to place greater restrictions on incoming traffic. When configuring a gateway connection for a home or office, we often block incoming traffic unless it relates to existing connections from the LAN. Unsolicited traffic does not make sense in this context and poses a security risk. To accomplish this feat, we will make use of netfilter's connection tracking extensions which are specified with the -m conntrack and --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED options.

Utilities like iptables and nftables provide a frontend and language for managing rules and actions that we want to perform based on the characteristics of network traffic. These tools are commonly used to implement services like NAT or to provide host or network-based packet filtering firewalls. Working with Local Traffic \u00b6 To better understand how all of this works, let\u2019s start with a simplified example on a standard Linux host. For now, ignore the possibility of routing and focus on the host\u2019s ability to send or receive packets. In this scenario, we can use netfilter for tasks like dropping unwanted traffic or rewriting addresses and layer-3 ports on the fly. Since this is a simplified scenario, we can limit our examination to two hooks, input and output , that are triggered for packets flowing to and from the local device in a non-routing scenario. By non-routing, we mean that the input hook is only invoked when the host is the intended recipient of the message based on the packet\u2019s destination IP address. Likewise, the output hook won\u2019t fire unless the message originated from the local host. Given the input / output hooks, we can use a frontend like iptables to register specific rules and actions that are evaluated for each packet passing through the network stack. Host-based Packet Filters \u00b6 One of the most common applications of the input / output hooks is to perform packet filtering in order to provide a host-based firewall for the Linux device. For example, from a security perspective, we typically want to limit how much of an \u201cattack surface\u201d we expose over the network. We can leverage the input hook to drop packets that aren\u2019t part of a TCP connection that we had previously initiated. In other words, we allow client-based software to open outbound connections but we block any attempts to connect to us as a server. If we need more flexibility, we can create rules to allow connections in to specific services, such as an HTTP or SSH daemon. Working with Routed Traffic \u00b6 Netfilter operations become slightly more complex when routing is introduced. Like an ordinary host, routers still process packets coming to/from the local device, but they also need to forward packets received on one network interface through other interfaces. In fact, this latter operation is their main responsibility. In order to support these communication paths, netfilter defines three additional hooks: forward , prerouting , and postrouting that we can use to perform network-based packet filtering, network address translation (NAT), and other packet-level operations. Network-based Packet Filters \u00b6 For network-based filtering, the forward hook is a direct analogue to the input / output hooks. As we\u2019ve mentioned, input / output are not applied to routed packets. Instead, code registered on the forward hook will be evaluated after the initial routing decision is made. The forward hook provides the basis for network-based firewall functionality. Network-based firewalls enable us to drop or reject unwanted traffic before it has the opportunity to reach our hosts (or even enter into the network). Likewise, we can also leverage packet filtering to prevent certain types of local traffic from inadvertently leaking outside our own network perimeters. Network Address Translation \u00b6 Sometimes it makes more sense to perform an action for an incoming packet before any routing decision has been made or just before actually sending an outgoing packet. This is the case for port and network address translation and is facilitated by attaching rules to the prerouting and postrouting hooks. Specifically, we set up rules on the prerouting hook when we want to modify incoming packets based on their destination IP address. This configuration is called destination NAT (DNAT) and is useful for delivering traffic to a server on a private subnet. Likewise, we use the postrouting hook when our goal is to change outgoing packets based on the original source address. This configuration is called source NAT (SNAT) and is useful when we need to map a public IP on to packets coming from private addresses. Additional Caveats for Local Traffic \u00b6 Unlike the forward hook, prerouting and postrouting may be used for local traffic as well as routed traffic. In particular, an incoming packet will be processed by the prerouting hook before the network stack makes a routing decision and reaches the input hook. For outgoing packets, the output hook is invoked prior to the outbound routing/forwarding decision or the postrouting hook. For local traffic, we often have a choice about which hook provides the best entry point for our rules. Summary \u00b6 When you're first learning about Linux networking internals, it can be difficult to remember the relationship between netfilter hooks and related events in the packet lifecycle. The following list summarizes what we've learned so far in terms of specific traffic flows. Incoming local traffic: (receive packet via network interface) -> prerouting -> (local routing decision) -> input -> (continue processing packet and deliver via sockets) Outgoing local traffic: (receive packet via sockets) -> output -> (outbound routing) -> postrouting -> (continue processing and send via network interface) Routed traffic: (receive packet via network interface) -> prerouting -> (inbound routing) -> forward -> (outbound routing) -> postrouting -> (continue processing and send via network interface) As you work to digest each of these traffic flows, you can refer to the following list for a reminder of which operations can be performed by using a particular hook.

Read the entire guide carefully before attempting to install the template or any of the other tools referenced here . What is nftables \u00b6 nftables is the default tool used to manage netfilter's packet filter rules in Raspberry Pi OS. Though nftables was originally released in 2014, it did not make its way into Raspberry Pi OS until the Bullseye release in November 2021. nftables is the successor to iptables , which has been in use within the Linux community for more than 20 years. nftables is a packet filtering framework included in a variety of modern Linux implementations. Packet filtering is a powerful technique that enables administrators to analyze and control the flow of inbound and outbound network traffic from any endpoint or intermediate network node. This level of control is essential for host- and network-based firewalls, network address translation (NAT), and other applications. Packet filters define rules to match traffic based primarily on Layer 2 - 4 properties, such as: the inbound or outbound interface, type and length of messages, addresses, ports, and connection state. Each filter also describes actions taken when a match is found, e.g., log, deliver, or drop the packet. netfilter-based packet filters can also be used to apply NAT, make decisions about Quality of Service, or to reroute packets mid-flight. nftables builds on netfilter , an open-source project adding hooks, connection tracking, and other capabilities to the Linux network stack. These components enable dynamic filters, like nftables rules, to be applied to every packet traversing the network stack. They are the secret sauce to many of the applications described above. Tables, Chains, and Rule Syntax \u00b6 In nftables , rules are composed of expressions that are used to select packets and statements that determine what actions netfilter will perform when a match occurs. While rules are the meat of our filter configurations, nftables doesn't allow them to stand alone. And so, before we explore the rule syntax, we need to looks tables and chains . Tables \u00b6 nftables uses a basic structure known as a table to organize rules. Each table is associated with a single address family and includes rules to apply to packets of that family. This guide is focused on layer-3 traffic and considers tables for the following three address families: ip : for IPv4 rules (default) ip6 : for IPv6 rules inet : for rules that apply to both IPv4 and IPv6 packets While its predecessor, iptables , included a default set of tables for common packet filter functionality, nftables administrators are left to define their own tables. For this exercise, we'll create an IPv4 nat table to implement address translation between private and public addresses and an IPv4/IPv6 filter table to protect the Pi and the rest of our LAN from malicious traffic. 1 Example: Empty filter and nat tables table inet filter { # Define chains (and rules) for IPv4 or IPv6 packets } table ip nat { # Define chains (and rules) for IPv4 packets } Chains \u00b6 Within each table, rules are grouped in chains . A chain is an ordered list of rules describing the packets to match and the action to take when a match is found. When a chain is processed, the rules in it are tested in order from the beginning until a match is found. If nftables finds a match while evaluating a rule, the remaining rules in that chain may be skipped depending on what action is taken. Base Chains \u00b6 nftables won't evaluate the rules in a chain automatically. Rather, a chain will only be processed if it is explicitly called from a rule in another chain or if the chain has been associated with a netfilter hook .A chain that is associated with a hook is called a base chain . Within the filter table, we are going to work with three base chains named input , output , and forward . These chains will be associated with filter hooks of the same names 2 , causing them to be processed when packets are being sent to software running on the Pi ( input hook), when packets are being sent out by software on the Pi ( output ) hook, or when packets are being routed by the Pi from one network to another ( forward hook). Example: Filter table and empty base chains table inet filter { chain input { type filter hook input priority 0; # Rules are evaluated when a packet is intended for this host } chain forward { type filter hook forward priority 0; # Rules are evaluated when an incoming packet will be forwarded by this host } chain output { type filter hook output priority 0; # Rules are evaluated when a packet is being sent from this host } } The nat table will have one base chain that is named for its respective hook , i.e., postrouting . Within netfilter, the postrouting hooks are the last ones to be processed when sending or forwarding a packet. As such, rules processed here can perform masquerading on the source IP addresses. 3 Example: NAT with postrouting base chain table ip nat { chain postrouting { type nat hook postrouting priority 100; # Rules are evaluated after forwarding decisions in order to support source NAT or masquerading } } Rules Syntax \u00b6 The basic nftables rule syntax includes an expression and a statement. Expressions define conditions that need to be satisfied before an action is applied to a packet. Statements define the actions that will be taken. Since actions are the simpler component of a rule, we'll begin our exploration there. Statements (actions) \u00b6 nftables statements are used to control packet flow, apply NAT transformations, compute metrics, record logs, and modify the order of rule evaluation. While the list below is not exhaustive, it is sufficient for this guide and the beginning firewall developer. accept : Stop processing chain and deliver packet drop : Stop processing chain and drop packet counter : Increment byte and packet counters and continue processing chain log : Write information about packet to logs and continue processing chain masquerade : Replace source IP address with the address of the output interface and stop processing chain You may observe that actions like drop and accept cause nftables to stop processing the current chain. These actions are known as terminal actions. Actions like log and counter are non-terminal because they allow nftables to continue processing even if a match had been found. nftables supports multiple actions in a single statement, but a terminal may only appear as the final component of a rule. For example, we can produce a rule that increments a counter and delivers a packet by ending our rule with counter accept . We can also write a rule that increments a counter and logs a packet without specifying a policy decision by ending the rule with counter log or log counter . However, we cannot combine terminals or include a terminal before a non-terminal as with accept counter or drop accept . Expressions (conditions) \u00b6 Our rules need to describe the packets we want to filter or manipulate. In this exercise, our primary consideration will be the direction in which a given packet is moving through the Pi. This is particularly of importance for routing decisions and NAT. We can describe our criteria by examining the ingress network for incoming packets and/or the egress network interface for outgoing packets. Attention Throughout the instructions, we'll refer to the internal interface as our <LAN> (because it serves our local network) and the external interface as the <WAN> (because it connects us to the Internet). Your configuration files will reflect the system assigned interface names, such as: eth0 and wlan0 . It's up to you to determine, based on your learning so far, which interface corresponds to which placeholder. Let's look at a rule that we can use to apply address translation to outbound packets. Since outbound packets will leave on the WAN, we can specify this restriction using the outbound interface name (oifname) condition, i.e., oifname <WAN> . The following example masquerades outbound traffic on the <WAN> interface. Example: Applying NAT transformation to outbound traffic table ip nat { chain postrouting { type nat hook postrouting priority srcnat; oifname <WAN> masquerade } } We can be even more specific with our rules by writing an expression with multiple conditionals. To identify outbound traffic forwarded from the LAN to the WAN, we can check both the inbound and outbound interface names by writing iifname <LAN> oifname <WAN> . The following example demonstrates a rule that explicitly accepts traffic flowing from <LAN> to <WAN> . Example: Combining multiple expressions table inet filter { chain forward { type filter hook forward priority 0; iifname <LAN> oifname <WAN> accept } } Using Connection State in Rules \u00b6 Netfilter is a stateful filtering framework, meaning that it is even possible to specify nftables rules based on the state of a network connection for a given packet. This feature shapes our rules in two ways. First, you'll notice that we only had to specify the masquerade rule in the egress direction. The same rule also handles the de-masquerading process for ingress packets. Second, you'll see that we can base filtering decisions on connection state itself. While it's appropriate for NAT routers to allow outgoing traffic, we typically want to place restrict incoming traffic. When configuring a gateway connection for a home or office, we often block incoming traffic unless it relates to existing connections from the LAN. Unsolicited traffic does not make sense in this context and poses a security risk. To accomplish this feat, we will make use of netfilter's connection tracking extensions and restrict incoming traffic to packets that are part of an established connection or related to a recent egress packet. The connection tracking portion of this expression is ct state established,related . Example: Using the connection tracking extension table inet filter { chain forward { type filter hook forward priority 0; iifname <WAN> ct state established,related accept } } Default Policy (for Base Chains) \u00b6 We are missing one piece to complete our configuration. By default, nftables accepts a packet unless a match occurs on a terminal rule. Base chains can override this behavior by defining a default policy. We'll use this feature to create a firewall that fail securely, i.e., blocking traffic that we don't explicitly allow. The following example adds a base chain policy in order to drop forwarded packets that we didn't allow from another rule. Example: Default drop policy table inet filter { chain forward { type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop; # Explicitly allow \"safe\" connections iifname <LAN> oifname <WAN> accept iifname <WAN> ct state established,related accept } } The default deny posture is a best practice for your networks and devices, but it's important to approach the strategy with care. Without additional rules, attaching policy drop to the input and output chains will block inbound and outbound SSH and other protocols that might be needed for remote management. We will come back to this in a later guide, but we recommend for now that you leave the default accept policy on these chains. Final NAT Template \u00b6 The following template draws together all of the components we have discussed so far to define a basic NAT configuration for a Linux router, leaving placeholder 4 elements for the reader to complete. Please review the previous examples and specifications that have been given in order to create a valid configuration. The following section will help you test and install your new ruleset. !!! info Routing / NAT template # Always flush the active ruleset before defining your new rules flush ruleset table inet filter { chain forward { type filter hook <HOOK> priority 0; policy <ACTION>; # Explicitly allow \"safe\" connections iifname <LAN> oifname <WAN> <ACTION> iifname <WAN> ct state established,related <ACTION> } chain input { type filter hook input priority 0; # You may leave this chain empty for now } chain output { type filter hook output priority 0; # You may leave this chain empty for now } } table ip nat { chain postrouting { type nat hook postrouting priority srcnat; oifname <WAN> masquerade } } Configuring nftables \u00b6 Throughout this guide, nftables configuration has been presented in a declarative, table-based format that closely reflects the table/chain/rule hierarchy. nftables also supports a command-based syntax that is passed to the nft utility on the command line or from within scripts in order to create, read, update, and delete individual elements of a ruleset dynamically. We generally want firewall and routing rules to be configured as soon as possible during the boot process. When the nftables service is started, Raspberry Pi OS will initialize it with the contents of /etc/nftables.conf . While experimentation is usually encouraged, you may encounter negative consequences if you make haphazard modifications to this file. A simple script is provided below to support the learning process by testing your ruleset before making changes permanent. Enable the nftables Service \u00b6 The nftables service may not be running by default on your device. You can check on the current status of the daemon with systemctl status nftables . To launch the service immediately, run systemctl start nftables . To ensure that nftables also starts automatically at boot, run systemctl enable nftables . Editing nftable Rules Safely \u00b6 Here be Dragons Do not write rules directly to /etc/nftables.conf . Without proper testing, you risk creating a rule that locks you out of your device from the network. Create a working copy of /etc/nftables.conf into your home directory (it is okay to rename the file) . Open the new copy and ensure that flush ruleset near the top (before your table definitions). 5 Proceed with any modifications to the working copy. To test your ruleset, we recommend a scripted approach that can automatically revert a change that locks you out of the Pi. INFO314 students can find a copy of nftables-apply.sh in the project repository or create the script from the following listing. nftables-apply.sh #!/bin/bash # Adapted from https://sanjuroe.dev/nft-safe-reload (retrieved on 2022-04-03) # Modified to avoid editing system rules in-place SYSTEM_RULES=\"/etc/nftables.conf\" TIMEOUT=45 saved_rules=$(mktemp) cleanup() { rm -f \"$saved_rules\" } trap \"cleanup\" EXIT; # Waits $TIMEOUT seconds for a yes/no response read_approval() { read -t $TIMEOUT response 2> /dev/null case \"$response\" in y|Y) return 0 ;; *) return 1 ;; esac } # Make a copy of the active ruleset backup() { printf \"flush ruleset\\n\" > $saved_rules nft list ruleset >> $saved_rules } # Apply a named ruleset apply() { nft -f \"$1\" } # Update system ruleset save() { local source_rules=\"$1\" cp --no-preserve=mode,ownership \"$source_rules\" \"$SYSTEM_RULES\" } # Make a backup of the active ruleset in case of rollback backup new_rules=\"$1\" if apply \"$new_rules\"; then printf \"Are you still able to connect to your device (auto-rollback in $TIMEOUT seconds)? [y/n] \" if read_approval; then save \"$new_rules\" printf \"\\nUpdated system ruleset at ${SYSTEM_RULES}\\n\" exit 0 else apply \"$saved_rules\" printf \"\\nRolling back to original configuration\\n\" exit 2 fi fi To test your rules, pass the name of your new rules file to the nftables-apply.sh script, e.g., ./nftables-apply.sh nftables-test.conf . If your rules load without any errors, you will be prompted to answer whether you can still connect. Open an additional terminal window and launch SSH to connect to your Pi. If you are able to complete this step successfully, you can apply your changes to /etc/nftables.conf by answering y at the nftables-apply prompt in your original session. If the test fails, answer n or wait 45 seconds for the rules to revert automatically. Once you are satisified that your rules are working correctly, it's a good idea to verify that your rules are loaded and that everything works correctly after a reboot. Use the nft list ruleset command to view active rules.

This feature shapes our rules in two ways. First, you'll notice that we only had to specify the masquerade rule in the egress direction. The same rule also handles the de-masquerading process for ingress packets. Second, you'll see that we can base filtering decisions on connection state itself. While it's appropriate for NAT routers to allow outgoing traffic, we typically want to place restrict incoming traffic. When configuring a gateway connection for a home or office, we often block incoming traffic unless it relates to existing connections from the LAN. Unsolicited traffic does not make sense in this context and poses a security risk. To accomplish this feat, we will make use of netfilter's connection tracking extensions and restrict incoming traffic to packets that are part of an established connection or related to a recent egress packet. The connection tracking portion of this expression is ct state established,related .

By default, nftables accepts a packet unless a match occurs on a terminal rule. Base chains can override this behavior by defining a default policy. We'll use this feature to create a firewall that fail securely, i.e., blocking traffic that we don't explicitly allow. The following example adds a base chain policy in order to drop forwarded packets that we didn't allow from another rule. Example: Default drop policy table inet filter { chain forward { type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop; # Explicitly allow \"safe\" connections iifname <LAN> oifname <WAN> accept iifname <WAN> ct state established,related accept } } The default deny posture is a best practice for your networks and devices, but it's important to approach the strategy with care. Without additional rules, attaching policy drop to the input and output chains will block inbound and outbound SSH and other protocols that might be needed for remote management.

The Pi is a compact, single-board computer that can be used to create a Linux-based router and other common network components. We recommend the 2GB version of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, but if you ever plan to do other projects with the device after this course, feel free to upgrade to the 4GB model. We don't recommend the kits because they don't align well with our needs, and you can often save a lot of money by only buying the parts you need. That being said, feel free to buy a kit if you want it for the convenience. Make sure that you get all of the 6 required minimal parts in the list above, though. If you are shipping within the US, you may be able to get reasonable delivery times from these suppliers (Amazon is quoting one month for Seattle, so don't order it there unless you the shipping time is faster where you live): PiShop.US (Recomended) Canakit Chicago Electronics Distributors Power \u00b6 You will need something to power the Raspberry Pi. Typically in this course, we use external USB battery banks, but since this course is now remote, you can rely on AC (wall outlet) power instead. If going the AC power route, you need a USB-C power supply. We recommend the official power supply found here , but it may be easier to order it with your Pi as an add-on item. You can use another power supply if you have one, provided it meets the required specifications. The power supply needs to provide 3 amps of current at 5 volts, and needs to have a USB-C at the charging end. You can see if your power supply provides 3 amps of current by looking on the back of the power supply, where it will say something like 5V3A; 5V, 3A; 3A; or 3000mA. Note: we are talking about amps (A) and milliamps (mA), NOT milliamp-hours (mAh). If it says something smaller, like 2.4A or 1A, that won't cut it , and you need something else, like the recommended model. Also, you will need to power your Pi while your computer is on, so please don't assume you can use your only laptop charger to power your Pi! If going the battery bank power route, you will need a strong USB battery bank. We recommended this power bank that we have tested to work great with the Pi. If you want to use your own, the battery bank must have 5 volt output at 3 amps, no less, and needs to have a USB-C at the charging end. You can check if your battery bank provides 3 amps of current by looking on the back of the battery bank, where it will say something like 5V3A; 5V, 3A; 3A; or 3000mA.

Because we are remote, the Pi should be safe without a case at your house, but please keep the cardboard box the Pi came in as a safe place to store it when not in use. Most cases protect the Pi within a plastic shell. Some cases come with extra supplies, like heatsinks (metal fins that stick on the chips on the Pi to provide passive cooling), or even fans to cool the Pi. These aren't necessary for this class, but do help your Pi push itself to its limits in terms of CPU power, so they are nice especially if you are planning to use your Pi for other projects after this course. Right now on Amazon, I only found one case that does not have one-month shipping times. Recommended Case . This case comes with a nice heatsink for passive cooling.

They have been tested on the February 2020 release of Raspbian Buster and on a Debian 10.3 droplet on DigitalOcean. Instructions may differ for other distributions or releases. Installing WireGuard \u00b6 Locating an Installation Package \u00b6 While WireGuard support has been added to recent versions of the Linux Kernel, this milestone was not reached until after the Debian and Raspbian teams had frozen features for Buster. At the time this guide was written, the WireGuard application and kernel module were not yet available in the mainline Debian and Raspbian package repositories. However, we can obtain these components from Debian's backport repository for Buster, a collection of new and updated software compiled for Buster. Depending on your installation, buster-backports may already be listed as a valid software source. We found this to be the case for Debian 10.3 on DigitalOcean, though on Raspbian, we needed to manually add buster-backports as a new source and import the signing keys used to verify the integrity of software installed from the repositories. Check Existing Package Sources \u00b6 Before you proceed, determine whether manual configuration of backports is necessary: # Search existing apt package source locations apt-cache policy | grep buster-backports Manually Configure Backports \u00b6 After completing the following steps, apt operations will consider packages from the backports repository while still preferring stable software versions from the mainline repository when available. # Import the PGP/GPG signing keys for buster-backports from a key server sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 04EE7237B7D453EC 648ACFD622F3D138 # Add the backports repositories to the apt configuration echo \"deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ buster-backports main contrib non-free\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-backports.list # Update the local software catalog via apt sudo apt update Install Linux Kernel Headers \u00b6 The WireGuard package in backports repository attempts to compile a kernel module in order to add WireGuard networking capabilities. To complete this task, the compiler must have access to kernel headers, a set of files that define the interface of kernel functions and data structures. The kernel headers are available as a package and accessible via apt . Installation depends on your chosen distribution: Installing Kernel Headers for Raspbian \u00b6 sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers Installing Kernel Headers for Debian \u00b6 # `uname -r` is used to specify the proper kernel version sudo apt install linux-headers- $( uname -r ) Install WireGuard and the DKMS-based module \u00b6 Finally, with the pre-requisites in place, we can use apt to install WireGuard and all of its supporting components. Once installed, you can use modprobe as shown below to verify that it the WireGuard kernel module is recognized by the kernel. # Install sudo apt install wireguard wireguard-dkms # Verify (should return without any output/error) sudo modprobe wireguard Getting Started with WireGuard \u00b6 The aim of the WireGuard project is to provide a fast and simple VPN that relies on rock-solid, modern cryptography. Generate a WireGuard Key Pair for each Server \u00b6 Every node participating in a WireGuard VPN is required to have a private key for its own use and a public key that will be distributed to each of its peers. Before setting up our own VPN, we need to generate these keys on each server. The following commands open a root-privileged shell in order to generate the keys. This extra step allows us to ensure proper file ownership and permissions via umask (which doesn't work smoothly with sudo) # Open a root shell sudo bash # Override default file creation permissions umask 077 # Create the public and private keys in /etc/wireguard wg genkey | tee -a /etc/wireguard/privatekey | wg pubkey > /etc/wireguard/publickey # Close the root shell exit After generating the keys for your servers, be sure to document the publickey for each endpoint. You\u2019ll need it again in order to configure each of your VPN peers. Identify Additional Parameters for your VPN \u00b6 Endpoint IP and Ports \u00b6 The endpoint addresses of a WireGuard VPN are the external addresses that peers will use in order to initiate connections with one another and to forward the encrypted payloads (via UDP datagrams that fully encapsulate the traffic sent/received on a virtual network interface). Each endpoint of a WireGuard VPN can function as both client and server (hence the name peer), however, taking full advanatage of this capability requires that all endpoints have routeable addresses. Due to NAT and/or firewall configurations, we may have endpoints that aren't directly reachable. WireGuard provides utilities to cope with this scenario, as long as at least one endpoint is able to receive incoming sessions from its peer(s). As with all servers, a routeable peer must define a port on which it will listen for incoming messages. WireGuard does not provide a standard port configuration, so it is up to administrators to determine an appropriate UDP port for WireGuard server to listen. Since we will be configuring multiple instances of WireGuard on our servers, we should pay close attention to which ports are in use so that we don't cause a collision between independent tunnel interfaces. In the following examples, we will assume that we have one publicly routeable peer and one located behind a NAT. We'll use port 51820 to listen for connections on the routeable peer. Tunnel IP addresses \u00b6 WireGuard VPN connections are presented at the OS level as layer-3 network interfaces and will be configured with their own IP subnet/address settings. The main constraint is that these addresses are not part of any other subnet connected to the same device. For example, if my LAN is using 172.27.2.0/26 and my home network is 10.0.1.0/24, I cannot use anything from 172.27.2.0 - 63 or 10.0.1.0 - 255. I could, however, use addresses above 172.27.2.64. The constraint above isn\u2019t anything unique to WireGuard, we\u2019re simply following the principle that you can\u2019t route between networks with overlapping IP ranges (in the same way that we can\u2019t give the same address to two nodes on the same network). The following examples will define tunnel addresses of 10.99.0.2 and 10.99.0.3 for traffic sent inside the VPN. Create WireGuard Interfaces \u00b6 In order to send and receive network traffic through a VPN, each peer is configured with a virtual network interface. Any traffic sent to this interface will be transported over the VPN tunnel. Incoming traffic will egress on this interface after being processed and decrypted by WireGuard. The following examples demonstrate the use of the ip command to manually set up the virtual interface for WireGuard. You should be aware that any configuration you set up with this utility is not persistent. It will be reset after a reboot. Persistent WireGuard configuration will be covered separately. # Create the virtual interface sudo ip link add dev wg0 type wireguard # Assign a tunnel address to the interface (your second peer will reverse the order of these arguments) sudo ip addr add dev wg0 10.99.0.2 peer 10.99.0.3 # Bring the interface online sudo ip link set up dev wg0 Create your Peers \u00b6 Configure wireguard to use the new virtual interface to maintain a tunnel with its peer. As in the previous step, we\u2019ll use the CLI interface to do this manually and come back later to add a persistent configuration. # Gather the public addresses for your peers (as applicable). You should have a public address for your DO peer, and you will need it to set up the Pi. Since the Pi is behind a NAT on your home network, we can't reach it directly with a public IPv4 address. As such, we'll always rely on the Pi to initiate the connection to Digital Ocean. I'll discuss implications of this later and how to deal with any limitations. # The core command looks like `wg set <INTERFACE> listen-port <PORT> private-key <PRIVATE KEY PATH> peer <PUBLIC KEY OF PEER> allowed-ips <List of CIDR IP ranges> endpoint <PUBLIC IP OF PEER>:<PORT>`. # Raspberry Pi / no public IP to listen on (replace public key and address of DO endpoint) sudo wg set wg0 private-key /etc/wireguard/privatekey peer ABCDEFG allowed-ips 0.0.0.0/0 endpoint A.B.C.D:51280 # DigitalOcean / has its own public IP to listen on but can't reach RPi directly wg set wg0 listen-port 51280 private-key /etc/wireguard/privatekey peer ABCDEFG allowed-ips 0.0.0.0/0 Observe how we adjusted the command when one of the peers doesn\u2019t have a routable public IP. The downside of this scenario is that the tunnel can only be initiated from one side of the link, and we won\u2019t be able to receive inbound traffic until it\u2019s open. We\u2019ll come back to discuss how to set up a keep-alive so that the tunnel is always open. When we have the luxury of public IP addresses for both peers, we should aim to set up both ends to listen and to connect to the peer endpoint. Test your Tunnel \u00b6 If everything has gone well to this point, make sure that you can ping each peer using its tunnel IP address. This may not seem like the most impressive feat , but we\u2019ll quickly expand the functionality by adding the ability to forward traffic between other attached networks. In order to do this, we need to set up routes for each subnet and add iptables rules that allow traffic to be forwarded on our new interfaces. If you\u2019d like to experiment with this on your own, check out the ip route command in order to program static routes. Our upcoming tasks will focus on using dynamic routing to automate the route configuration for the entire class network (which will have more than 30 routers and subnets).","title":"Install and Configure WireGuard"},{"location":"resources/setup-wireguard/#installing-and-configuring-wireguard-on-raspbian-and-debian-based-linux","text":"","title":"Installing and Configuring WireGuard on Raspbian and Debian-based Linux"},{"location":"resources/setup-wireguard/#before-you-begin","text":"These instructions will aide you with installation of WireGuard on Raspbian/Debian Buster.

While you can use a standard password, it is not a smart security practice. Rather, it's important to learn to generate and use a public keypair for SSH. A keypair is composed of a private key and a public key. Your public key can be given out, to say, GitHub or DigitalOcean, while your private key should never leave your device. OpenSSH is shipped with a utility called ssh-keygen that will generate a keypair for you. To create your SSH keypair, use ssh-keygen as follows: With either Terminal (for Mac) or PowerShell/Git Bash (for Windows) run the following command with your own email address: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C <DESCRIPTION> When prompted for a file name for the private SSH key. Accept the default by pressing ++Enter++. 1 You will be prompted for a passphrase. This is important as it is used to protect your private SSH key. Make it something strong, like you would a password, and commit it to memory or write it down somewhere. Assuming that you accepted the default location above, your keys will be saved to ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 (private) and ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub (public). (OPTIONAL STEP) To avoid having to enter the passphrase every time you use your private key, continue to set up the ssh-agent as described in this tutorial . Register Client Keys with a Server \u00b6 In order to connect to a server using an SSH keypair, the server will need a copy of the public key to associate with a user account on the system. By default, each user will have a .ssh folder in their home directory. When a user attempts to log in via an SSH connection, the server will look for a file named ~/.ssh/authorized_keys containing a list of public keys. The client proceeds to authenticate itself by proving to the server that it is in possession of a matching private key. To use this feature on a Linux server, create the .ssh directory in your home directory (on the server). If you're already logged in, you can create the directory using mkdir -p ~/.ssh . After that is done, type exit to terminate the connection and return to your local command prompt. You are here!!! The following commands are run from your local shell. Running them inside of an existing SSH session will not have the effect you are looking for. With the directory in place, copy your public key (most likely ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ) to the server using the scp command 2 scp $HOME /.ssh/id_ed25519.pub pi@raspberrypi.local:.ssh/authorized_keys By default, your SSH keys will be saved to ~/.ssh . If you are prompted to overwrite an existing key, you can cancel the process by typing n and pressing ++Enter++. \u21a9 The first parameter to scp specifies the name of the local file. The example is copying the public key named id_ed25519.pub from the current user's home directory. The second parameter to scp names the user ( pi ), the host ( raspberrypi.local ), and the remote destination for the file ( .ssh/authorized_keys ). Like ssh , scp is a user-based tool and will be executed relative to the home directory of the authenticated user ( /home/pi ). We can override the default by specifying an absolute path beginning with a / , e.g., /home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys . \u21a9","title":"Getting Started with SSH"},{"location":"resources/ssh-primer/#getting-started-with-ssh","text":"SSH stands for 'Secure Shell'.

These networks serve slightly different purposes with each one employing a distinct security configuration to ensure that Internet access is restricted to current students, staff, and faculty. The University of Washington SSID is an open network that employs a captive portal . In order to access any site outside of the UW network, you must authenticate your session using your NetID username and password. Since a browser is needed at the time you connect, this is not an ideal solution for a headless network device. The eduroam SSID is an encrypted, WPA2 Enterprise network that requires new device onboarding before making a connection. The UW MPSK network is an encrypted WPA2 Personal network, much like the one you might use at home, except that an online onboarding step (described in the next section) is required for each device you want to connect. Additional information about these networks is available at https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/uw-networks/campus-wi-fi/ . UW MPSK Network Onboarding \u00b6 The UW MPSK network is a good fit for gaming consoles and IoT devices that operate without a screen and keyboard. To connect to his network, you will need to register through the UW IT website and obtain a passphrase (which is unique to each device). In order to complete these instructions, you will need the following information: Your NetID and Password The MAC address of the device you want to register 1 http://register.wifi.uw.edu/guest/mac_create.php Eduroam Onboarding \u00b6 In prior years, access to eduroam relied on username/password authentication through the University's NetID system. Authentication was performed by the wireless client -- wpa_supplicant in our case -- when connecting to the system. If a user had a valid NetID, no prior registration was needed. As of February 2022, the university quit accepting NetID based connections and began requiring all wireless clients to be registered and set up ahead of time with a client certificate. UW provides a portal and tools that automate most of this process for mainstream desktop systems; however, those tools aren't compatible Raspberry Pi OS. The following instructions will guide you through connecting to the onboarding portal, registering your device, downloading your client identity certificates, and installing these credentials onto your Raspberry Pi. In order to complete these instructions, you will need to gather the following information: Your NetID and Password The MAC address of the device you want to register 1 A passphrase that will be used to encrypt your new certificates.

By default, in Raspberry Pi OS, the name of this file is wpa_supplicant.conf . You may also encounter an interface-specific configuration where the interface name is appended to the file, e.g., wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf . In both cases, the file is owned by root and requires root privileges to read or edit. To learn more about wpa_supplicant , run the command ` Security Risk wpa_supplicant.conf is protected from casual reading due to the fact that it is a sensitive file that might contain the password to your home network or even the password for your school/work account. Practice caution with this file: Never share the contents of this file directly online. Scrub passwords, keys, and hashes before committing a copy into a repository . Reset passwords if you lose your Pi or suspect that you may have disclosed it inadvertently. You can edit wpa_supplicant configs directly on the Pi using any terminal-based text editor. Alternatively, you can create the file on your local system and copy it into place on the Pi (as described later in this guide). Warning: Windows line-endings and rich text format As students get started with Linux networking, we frequently encounter problems related to the overall file format. As a rule, the configuration files you create in this class must be plain text with standard line endings. You'll want to stick to using a code-oriented text editor, as opposed to options like macOS TextEdit and Windows Notepad that often save files as rich text rather than plain text. For Windows users, a code-oriented editor will also help you avoid issues related to line endings. While most operating systems use a simple New Line (aka Line Feed) control character to signify the end of a line, most Windows tools also include a Carriage Return . This alternate line ending causes parsing errors in many Linux tools. The general structure of the configuration file is show below. The file begins with a standard set of parameters specifying the country (needed to initialize appropriate radio settings), a control interface used by network management tools, and a boolean that instructs wpa_supplicant to accept configuration updates from other network management tools. We won't delve any deeper into the meaning of these initial parameters for now. Rather, our concern will be how to configure Linux to join nearby wireless networks. Example wpa_supplicant.conf country=US ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev update_config=1 network={ ssid=\"Some public network\" key_mgmt=NONE } network={ ssid=\"My home network\" psk=\"Don't tell anyone the password\" } Each network is represented by a configuration block that surrounded by network={...} . The contents of the network block will depend largely on the security settings of the network, e.g., whether or not the network is encrypted with a passphrase. This document provides instructions for configuring three common types of networks: Unencrypted Networks WPA2 Personal Networks (simple passphrase) WPA2 Enterprise Networks Let's start by examining the configuration for an unencrypted network. Unencrypted Networks \u00b6 All networks are defined by parameter=value pairs enclosed within network={} . Regardless of security configuration, each network block is required to contain an ssid parameter identifying the network. The service set identifier (SSID) is the network name that you see on your device when you connect to a wireless network. Since this name may include whitespace, we encapsulate it in double quotes. In addition to the ssid , wpa_supplicant expects us to provide encryption a passphrase and other encryption settings for the wireless network. Omitting these settings, even for an unencrypted network, will result in errors. Instead, for unencrypted networks, we explicitly disable encryption with key_mgmt=NONE . Configuration for an unencrypted network network={ ssid=\"Coffee Shop\" key_mgmt=NONE } WPA2 Personal Networks \u00b6 For a basic (non-enterprise) encrypted network, the configuration of the network block changes only slightly. Rather than specify the key_mgmt setting, we assign the network passphrase to the psk parameter. There are two ways to accomplish this task. First, we can assign the passphrase directly to the parameter in plaintext as shown here: Danger: Don't do this!!! network={ ssid=\"Home Wifi\" psk=\"super secret squirrels\" } Security professionals generally frown on plaintext passwords and passphrases being written to configuration files or code. As such, we prefer to write the configuration based on the raw network key (computed using a function called PBKDF in conjunction with SHA1 ). Using wpa_passphrase to generate a raw PSK You can generate the raw psk directly on your Pi by running the wpa_passphrase utility. This utility takes your SSID as an argument and then prompts you to enter your passphrase. # Pass your SSID as the first argument wpa_passphrase \"Home Wifi\" You will not see any characters or placeholders echoed as you type the passphrase, but wpa_passphrase will continue to accept input until you hit Enter/Return . The output will be a valid wpa_supplicant configuration that you can paste into your configuration. network={ ssid=\"Home Wifi\" psk=2508539ff867a3578f6ba7d9ee1d4a62aea82c25d30ffb1eb3a05cd08a373c02 } WPA2 Enterprise Networks \u00b6 Unlike home and coffee shop networks, enterprise networks like eduroam , require a bit more setup since they authenticate individual users to the network as part of the process of establishing an encrypted connection. As such, these networks can provide substantially more security than networks that are protected by WPA2 Personal . They're also much more flexible. For example, once you have properly configured eduroam to connect on your campus, you will also be able to get online at other schools offering eduroam hotspots. Certificate-based Authentication \u00b6 Enterprise networks utilizing certificate-based authentication rely on EAP-TLS mode of operation. Public key authentication has many security benefits over password-based mechanisms, though the process of onboarding new users and devices is more complex. Users on these networks are required to register or enroll in order to obtain a client identity certificate. Before you attempt to add an EAP-TLS network to wpa_supplicant, you must complete the onboarding process and install certificates onto your device. For University of Washington students, faculty, and staff, we have documented onboarding and certificate installation in separately (click here) . Eduroam configuration template (EAP-TLS) The majority of the values needed for this template will be provided by your organization during onboarding. For , your organization most likely supports CCMP , which is a mode of AES encryption. If you're unsure, enter CCMP TKIP to allow for legacy encryption support (not recommended). All path names will be dependent on the installation location for your certificates. network={ priority=10 ssid=\"eduroam\" scan_ssid=1 key_mgmt=WPA-EAP proto=RSN pairwise=<ENCRYPTION_MODES> group=<ENCRYPTION_MODES> eap=TLS identity=\"<IDENTITY>\" anonymous_identity=\"<ANONYMOUS_IDENTITY>\" ca_cert=\"</PATH/TO/CA_CERT.PEM>\" client_cert=\"</PATH/TO/CLIENT_CERT.PEM>\" private_key=\"</PATH/TO/PRIVATE_KEY.PEM>\" domain_match=\"<DOMAIN>\" phase2=\"auth=<INNER_EAP_TYPE>\" } Password-based Authentication \u00b6 Password-based authentication can be set up for an enterprise wireless network by leveraging the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) and the Microsoft Challenge Authentication Protocol version 2 (MSCHAPv2) to authenticate network clients based on a previously registered username and passphrase. The following template configures wpa_supplicant for PEAP/MSCHAPv2 authentication on an Eduroam network. Add it to your wpa_supplicant.conf , substituting your own username and password hash for the supplied values. Avoid Credential Exposure If implemented poorly, PEAP can expose your password to a malicious network operator. To prevent attacks, include the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate 1 in your wpa_supplicant configuration. Without this information, the wireless client may send password information to an evil twin (malicious network posing as one you trust). Likewise, we advise against hard-coding your plaintext school or work password into the wireless configuration file. Instead, compute an MD4 hash from your password and substitute it for the password. MD4 is a weak hash and fairly vulnerable to password cracking, but combined with a strong password, it does provide a layer of protection if your device is lost or stolen. Follow these commands in order to compute the MD4 hash in Linux. The history commands are not needed to compute a hash but are added for security. Without them, your password will be stored in the Bash history file and easily readable to anyone with access to your memory card. set +o history echo -n 'This is your password' | iconv -t utf16le | openssl md4 # You should see output like 6f9bad2c90b80bd549e595fc91e27806 set -o history Eduroam configuration template (EAP-PEAP) This configuration is no longer supported on University of Washington's eduroam network (effective Feb 1, 2022). network={ ssid=\"eduroam\" scan_ssid=1 key_mgmt=WPA-EAP proto=RSN eap=PEAP identity=\"<USERNAME>@<ORGANIZATION_DOMAIN>\" password=hash:6f9bad2c90b80bd549e595fc91e27806 ca_cert=\"</PATH/TO/CA_CERT.PEM>\" phase1=\"peaplabel=0\" phase2=\"auth=MSCHAPV2\" } Applying Configuration Changes \u00b6 Like other services, wpa_supplicant will not load our changes automatically. Rather than reset the daemon completely using systemctl , we can use wpa_cli to update the configuration and perform other basic maintenance. When running wpa_cli we need to specify the interface we are configuring and a command to send to the wpa_supplicant service. Load configuration from wpa_supplicant.conf # Update configuration from disk wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure # Check the status of current connection wpa_cli -i wlan0 status See man wpa_cli for further instructions and examples.

Absolute names are commonly called fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and include all parts of the name from the the host to the root of the DNS hierarchy. When configuring DNS servers, FQDNs are always terminated with a trailing dot, e.g., www.washington.edu. . Relative names omit the domain portion of the address and the trailing dot, e.g., www . When BIND encounters a hostname without the trailing dot in a zone file, it implicitly inserts the domain portion of the address. Forgetting to terminate an absolute hostname such as www.washington.edu with the trailing period will result in errors since BIND will see the resource as www.washington.edu.washington.edu. . Shorthand \u00b6 The standard zone file format employs a number of shortcuts that allow certain fields to be omitted or shortened. BIND will use the global $TTL value as a default for records that do not specify their own. A hostname of @ is shorthand for the default domain name for the zone. This value will be explicitly defined by the $ORIGIN directive at the start of a zone file or learned implicitly by the server based on the server's configuration. When specifying multiple records in a row with the same name, you can omit the name after the first record. Common Record Types \u00b6 SOA Record Data \u00b6 A valid zone file begins with the Start of Authority record. This record provides information about the primary servers for the domain and defines parameters to control the behavior of secondary servers. RDATA for SOA includes the following fields: MNAME specifies the name server that is the primary source of data about this domain. RNAME is the email address of the administrator for the zone. RFC 2142 recommends that every domain provides a hostmaster mailbox to receive support queries related to the domain. **Special formatting applies for the RNAME (see below). SERIAL is an unsigned 32-bit version number of the zone-file used to detect updates. This number must be incremented every time the zone file is updated. RFC 1912 recommends using the numerically formatted date followed by a 2 digit revision number, i.e., YYYYMMDDnn . REFRESH defines the number of seconds after which secondary name servers should query the master for the SOA record to determine whether there are any updates to the zone. RIPE's recommendation for small and stable zones is 86400 seconds (24 hours). RETRY defines the number of seconds a secondary name server should wait to retry its refresh query if the master does not respond. RIPE's recommendation for small and stable zones is 7200 seconds (2 hours). EXPIRE defines the number of seconds before expiring the current set of records if the master does not respond. RIPE's recommendation for small and stable zones is 3600000 seconds (1000 hours). TTL defines a time to live value that is used by recent servers to determine how long to cache a negative DNS result and by older servers to determine the default TTL for resources that don't specify it explicitly. RIPE's recommendation for small and stable zones is 172800 seconds (2 days). When formatting an email address for the RNAME field, You must escape any period in the username portion of the address with a \\ and replace the @ symbol with an unescaped period. Do not escape periods in the domain portion of the address. An example can be seen in the following SOA record. ; ; Example SOA record for washington.edu ; Primary NS - hanna.cac.washington.edu ; Administrative Email - domainmaster@cac.washington.edu ; washington.edu. 462 IN SOA hanna.cac.washington.edu. domainmaster.cac.washington.edu. 2019021600 3600 1800 3600000 600 ; ; Use parenthesis to split the record across lines for readability ; washington.edu. 462 IN SOA hanna.cac.washington.edu. domainmaster.cac.washington.edu ( 2019021600 ; SERIAL 3600 ; REFRESH (1 hour) 1800 ; RETRY (30 minutes) 3600000 ; EXPIRE (1000 hours) 600 ; TTL (10 minutes) ) NS Record Data \u00b6 Name Server records are used to indicate the servers that host the zone file for a domain. A zone file will normally include its own name servers and the name servers of any subdomains. In a real world scenario, your domains should be hosted by at least two name servers. NS records refer to the hostname of a server. Assigning an IP address to a NS record is a misconfiguration. Rather a zone file can define glue records, A and AAAA address records that tie the name servers' hostnames to IP addresses. Glue records are required when a zone hosts its own authoritative name servers. ; Name Server washington.edu. 86400 IN NS hanna.cac.washington.edu. ; Glue Records hanna.cac.washington.edu. 86400 IN A 140.142.5.5 hanna.cac.washington.edu. 86400 IN AAAA 2607:4000:200:42::5 A and AAAA Record Data \u00b6 Address records map hostnames to IP addresses. The value of an A record in a BIND zone file is simply the IPv4 address in dotted decimal notation. For AAAA records, BIND supports the standard shorthand rules for IPv6. It is legal (and common) for multiple address records to be provided for a given hostname. This feature allows us to support dual stack hosts that can be reached using either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, but it also enables us to distribute traffic between multiple servers for redundancy and load balancing. This configuration is referred to as round-robin DNS and can be seen in the following example: ; ; Subsequent DNS responses will list records in a random order ; www.washington.edu. IN A 128.95.155.134 www.washington.edu. IN A 128.95.155.197 www.washington.edu. IN A 128.95.155.198 CNAME Record Data \u00b6 Canonical Name records define aliases for hostnames. CNAME records have many uses, including mapping alternate domain registrations to a primary domain (as seen below) or to improve the stability of DNS records when we do not have direct control over the underlying infrastructure. ; ; www.uw.edu can be used as an alias for www.washington.edu ; www.uw.edu. IN CNAME www.washington.edu. While CNAME records can be quite useful, there are several important restrictions to keep in mind: Do not define a CNAME record for the apex domain name , i.e., the name of the domain without any host prefix. Do not define a CNAME as the target of an MX or NS record. The target of an MX or NS must always resolve to an A or AAAA record. Do not define any other records for a hostname that is given a CNAME record. For example, since www.uw.edu has a CNAME, it cannot also be given an A record or a TXT record. MX Record Data \u00b6 Mail Exchanger records are used to specify the servers that will receive mail for a given domain. An individual MX record include an integer priority and a hostname. It is common and recommended to define multiple MX records for a domain. The priority field is used by mail agents to determine the preferred mail server (lower values are given higher priority). ; ; Since the three servers listed here have equal priority, a mail ; agent will choose one at random. ; washington.edu. 10800 IN MX 100 mxe30.s.uw.edu. washington.edu. 10800 IN MX 100 mxe31.s.uw.edu. washington.edu. 10800 IN MX 100 mxe32.s.uw.edu. ; ; The hostnames referred to by MX records must resolve to address ; records are hosted in the zone for uw.edu, e.g., ; mxe30.s.uw.edu. 86400 IN A 173.250.227.19 TXT Record Data \u00b6 Text records hold freeform text that is generally intended for use by external services. TXT records are frequently used to: * Verify ownership of a domain, e.g., required to set up 3 rd party email hosting or obtain a certificate for TLS. * Support SPAM reduction technologies such as the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identfied Mail (DKIM). ; ; SPF uses TXT to indicate which networks or hosts may be used to send ; email on behalf of a domain. Recipients may flag or drop email that ; originated from an alternate server. ; uw.edu. 3600 IN TXT \"v=spf1 ip4:128.95.242.222/32 ip4:128.208.0.5/32 ip4:128.208.181.0/26 ip4:140.142.32.0/24 ip4:140.142.234.128/25 ip4:173.250.227.0/24 ?all\" References \u00b6 RFC 1912: Common DNS Operational and Configuration Errors RFC 2142: Mailbox Names for Common Services, Roles, and Functions RIPE 203: Recommendations for DNS SOA Values","title":"Zone File Reference"},{"location":"resources/zone-file-format/#bind-zone-files","text":"A DNS zone file is a text file that describes a DNS zone and provides the list of all resource records that are defined in the zone.
