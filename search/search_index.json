If you re-commit to your repo please re-submit on Canvas. Late commits will use your late days. Deliverables Question -1: It is recommended that you bold the questions. This makes it easier to differentiate your answer from the question. After which you can put your answer below.

You should already be familiar with bash from INFO 201 and INFO 340. This following section will help you refresh some of the basics. !!! info \"Huh, Bash?\" If you feel completely lost and have never seen terminal commands we recommend watching these two videos: - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag\" target=\"_blank\">Beginner's Guide to the Bash Terminal</a> - <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/shell-workshop--ud206\" target=\"_blank\">Udacity Shell Workshop</a> Directories cd to change directories ls to show files and directories at your current path ls -a to also show hidden files Editing files If you are editing a file on a remote server such as your Pi, you will not have the luxury of using a nice editor such as VS Code, Atom, or Sublime. Nevertheless, there are many powerful terminal editors. Use nano or vim to edit files through your terminal. How to edit a file that's on a linux server/your Pi: Use nano <fileName> or vim <filename> Nano is beginner friendly. If you are unfamiliar with these I recommend looking up a nano tutorial. Command documentation If you don't know what a command does or how to use it simply use the man command! man <commandName> will print out an documentation. Once you're done reading hit q on your keyboard to quit out. In the following screenshots I enter man nslookup which provides me with more information on what nslookup does and how it's used. Services: starting, stopping, status Control services by using the systemctl command. The format is sudo systemctl <action> <service name> . Most used !!! example Restart NGINX service: sudo systemctl restart nginx Copy files / scp You can copy files from your laptop to a server or a server to your laptop by using scp . It uses our ssh tunnel to securely transfer your files back and forth. You can find great examples at hyperx.org . Copy all of the contents of a folder: :::bash scp -r ava/* root@157.230.163.231:/var/www/html/ This copies everything in the ava folder to the html folder. Local vs Remote A typical confusion for students when deadling with scp is whether their current terminal session is doing work on their local machine (your laptop), or on a remote machine (your Raspberry Pi or another server). You can tell which device your terminal session is doing work in by checking the hostname, that is whatever is after the @ symbol. Take a look at the two example tabs below. ``` bash tab=\"Local\" hostname = macbook-pro This tells me I'm on my laptop. ben@macbook-pro:~/Desktop/info-314/ ``` bash tab=\"Remote\" # hostname = debian-lab1 # I must be on my server now. ben@debian-lab1:~$ Logs Check a service's logs. This is a great way to see if it ran into any errors. If for some reason a service keeps crashing or behaving strangely you'd want to dig into its logs and see if it's unhappy with something. :::bash sudo journcalctl -u <service name> If you specifically only want to see the most recent parts of the log, you can pipe the information it gives you into the tail command, which only shows any files' ending lines. :::bash sudo journalctl -u <service name here>.service | tail -n 100","title":"Intro to Bash"},{"location":"bash/#intro-to-bash","text":"Bash command, terminal command, command line command, for the purpose of our class these all mean the same things.

We will both be available on Slack for questions. Nevertheless it is expected that you will have attempted to solve the issue as much as possible before reaching out for help. Below are some guidelines: When should I reach out? You should reach out for help if you have: Written down what your problem is Written down why you think you are seeing this behavior Completed your own debugging Completed your own research How should I ask? It is highly encourages that you ask your questions in a Slack Channel. You will get a response back much more quickly either from a student are teaching staff this way.

You will be expected to use this syntax for most of your class reports. You will find a file called README.md in the root of all of your GitHub repo folders. This is where you will be doing most of your markdown work. How do I get started? Don't worry if you are unfamiliar with Markdown, it's really easy to pick up. Github has great documentation on all of the things you can do with it here: mastering-markdown guide. Once you've taken a look at it follow this beginner's tutorial: markdowntutorial.com . Preview Markdown When you're editing your md file in your computer, you'll want to know what your text would look like on Github as you're typing. I recommend installing a couple extensions on VS code in order to make your life easier: Markdown Preview Github and Markdown All in One . Each has instructions at the time of installation on how to use them. Markdown -> PDF grip is a command line tool that will easily convert your markdown file to a pdf or html file.

Many of the labs and exercises are built around Raspberry Pi 3 Model B/B+ hardware. The Pi is a compact, single-board computer that can be used to create a Linux-based router and other common network components. TLDR; Order the Raspberry Pi hardware. Instructions and links can be found at this Amazon link . Please only buy one of each category, don't buy duplicates, for example there is no need to buy two cases. Do not use or buy any model that is older than the 3B . Details Compute (and case) Either the Pi Model 3B or 3B+ will meet the requirements for this course. You may be able to complete the projects with an older Pi or other single-board computer. If you do run into issues later in the course, we should be able to provide you with a loaner to complete remaining assignments. Please talk to the instructor at the start of the quarter if this is your intention. Since the Pi ships as a bare circuit board, you\u2019ll want some sort of case to provide protection. The official case linked on my Amazon list runs about $7, but there are many other options as well. If you\u2019re feeling thrifty, you can even make something out of a heavy paper or other materials you already have (\u200bhttp://sixes.net/rdcHQ/mosh/raspberry.pi.b.plus.pdf\u200b). Power Like all computers and electronics, the Pi needs a good source of power. The specs for the power source are incredibly important. While there are plenty of USB power bricks and cables around, you need a set that will provide 5V at a minimum of 2.4A. If your equipment does not meet these specs (or you have low quality cables), you\u2019re likely to experience a lot of frustration as you work on later labs and place more demand on your Pi. We tried out all sorts of solutions in previous quarters, but the most convenient is to utilize a USB battery pack with a microUSB connector. After much searching, I came up with a couple of options that work well and can be picked up on Amazon for less than $15. Unless you understand how to verify power specifications, I recommend that you follow our recommendations. Storage The Pi has very simple storage requirements. It relies on a microSD card of the sort you would use in a digital camera or cell phone. We recommend an 8 - 16GB card that meets the Class 10 or UHS-1 speed specifications. Since prices move around a lot, I\u2019ve included several cards that I\u2019ve tested on the Amazon list. If you can afford it, a second storage card or a small USB flash drive may be useful. It\u2019s relatively easy to boot the Pi to a USB drive if you end up needing to troubleshoot a non-booting Pi without a monitor or keyboard.","title":"Buy Raspberry Pi Materials"},{"location":"resources/pi-materials/#buy-raspberry-pi-materials","text":"Order the required materials as soon as possible.","title":"Buy Raspberry Pi Materials"},{"location":"resources/pi-materials/#what-is-a-pi","text":"Many of the labs and exercises are built around Raspberry Pi 3 Model B/B+ hardware.
